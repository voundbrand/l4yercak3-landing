      title: "The Infrastructure Trap",
      subtitle: "You have a great product idea. You have funding. You have a technical team. So why does it feel like you're building the same thing every other startup builds?",
      description: "Authentication. Payments. Email systems. Database architecture. Admin dashboards. File storage. AI integration. Before you write a single line of product code, you're facing 3-6 months of infrastructure work. And here's the brutal truth: none of this gives you competitive advantage. Your users don't care how elegantly you implemented OAuth. They care about the product you promised them.",
      hiddenTruth: {
        title: "What VCs Won't Tell You",
        secret: "Here's what we've learned from watching hundreds of funded startups: The ones that succeed aren't the ones with the best infrastructure. They're the ones that got to market fastest.",
        explanation: "Every week you spend building auth is a week your competitors are talking to customers. Every sprint on payments integration is a sprint not spent on your core differentiator. Every month on infrastructure is a month of burn rate without product progress.",
        revelation: "But what if you could skip all that? What if the infrastructure was already built, battle-tested, and ready for you to customize? What if you could go from funding to market in 12 weeks instead of 12 months?"

      realCost: {
        title: "The Math That Changes Everything",
        description: "Let's do the real calculation that most founders avoid:",
        discovery: "A senior developer costs €80-120/hour fully loaded. Infrastructure takes 12-20 weeks with a competent team. That's €50,000-150,000 in engineering time before your first product feature ships. But that's not even the real cost.",
        impact: "The real cost is time-to-market. Every month of delay is a month of runway burned. A month where competitors move faster. A month where market conditions change. A month where your early believers start wondering when they'll see the product you pitched them.",
        conclusion: "The startups that figure this out first are the ones that win."

      networksDescription: "Build Sprint isn't for everyone. We work with funded founders and technical teams who understand that speed-to-market is everything. Teams that would rather spend 12 weeks building product than 12 months building infrastructure. Founders who know the difference between 'we built it ourselves' and 'we shipped it first.'",
      selectionTitle: "Limited Capacity",
      selectionDescription: "We take on a limited number of Build Sprint clients each quarter. Why? Because we're not selling software—we're partnering with you to ship your product. We learn your domain. We customize our platform for your needs. We're in the trenches with you for 12 weeks. That level of partnership doesn't scale infinitely.",

        "Willingness to move fast and make decisions quickly"

Instead, we shipped our MVP in week 8 and spent months 2-3 iterating with real users.' That's not just faster—it's a fundamentally different trajectory. Real user feedback in weeks instead of months. Product-market fit signals before your runway is half gone. A team focused on what makes you unique instead of commodity infrastructure.",

Week 9-12: Polish, testing, and launch preparation. We ensure your product is production-ready, scalable, and secure.",
