# Category System

Categories organize posts within the school community, allowing for structured content management with customizable permissions and sorting.

---

## Category Settings

Each category has three configurable options:

### 1. Name
- The display name for the category
- Should clearly describe the type of content it contains

### 2. Posting Permissions
- **Members and Admins can post** - Open posting for all community members
- **Only Admins can post** - Restricted posting, members can only view and comment

### 3. Sort Method
How posts appear by default within the category:
- **New** - Most recent posts first
- **Top of the Week** - Highest engagement from the past 7 days
- **Top of the Month** - Highest engagement from the past 30 days

---

## Category Organization

- Categories can be reordered by moving them up or down
- Order determines how categories appear in the navigation
- Place most important or frequently used categories near the top

## Recommended Categories for L4YERCAK3 Free Community

| # | Category | Permissions | Sort | Purpose |
|---|----------|-------------|------|---------|
| 1 | **General** | Members + Admins | New | Main discussion, questions, intros, wins - everything |
| 2 | **Lessons** | Members + Admins | Top of the Week | Community-contributed tutorials, guides, insights |
| 3 | **Premium** | Admins only | New | Your premium content posts |
| 4 | **VIP** | Admins only | New | Your VIP content posts |

## Category Rationale

**General** - The catch-all. Intros, questions, wins, hot takes, show your work - it all goes here. Keeps it simple. You can require a minimum level to post (prevents spam from brand new accounts).

**Lessons** - Members can post their own tutorials and insights. Drives community ownership - people teach what they know. Best content rises to top with "Top of the Week" sorting.

**Premium** - Admin-only. You post premium tier content here. Members see what they're missing, creates upgrade incentive.

**VIP** - Admin-only. You post VIP tier content here. Same idea - visible but locked for non-VIP members.
