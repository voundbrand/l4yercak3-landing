## Script

```
Let me tell you what's broken about learning to build software.

You take a course. You follow along. You build a to-do app or a calculator that nobody will ever use. You add it to your portfolio. You apply for jobs or try to land clients. And you hear the same thing over and over:

"Do you have experience with real projects?"

No. Because nobody let you work on real projects. It's a catch-22. You can't get experience without experience.

So you keep buying courses. Keep building fake projects. Keep wondering when it's going to click.

Here's the thing nobody tells you: It doesn't click from watching. It clicks from shipping. Real software. For real clients. With real stakes.

That's what the apprenticeship is.

You don't learn from me. You work with me.

When I land a client project - a lead gen system, an automation build, a SaaS product - you're in the room. Not watching a recording. Actually building. Actual tasks. Actual deliverables. Actual deadlines.

You'll ship software that real businesses pay for. You'll see how I scope projects, how I communicate with clients, how I handle problems when things break. Because things always break.

And when we deliver? You get paid. Revenue share on every project you help ship.

This isn't a course. It's an apprenticeship. The way people actually learned trades for hundreds of years before someone decided to put everything behind a paywall and call it an "online program."

Here's how it works.

You pay €5,000 to get in. That's your skin in the game. It tells me you're serious.

You join the next client project. Could be a few days after you sign up, could be a couple weeks. Depends on the pipeline.

You work alongside me for the duration of the project. We communicate daily. You get assigned real tasks. You ship real code. Or real automations. Or real systems. Whatever the project needs.

When the project delivers and the client pays, you get a percentage of the revenue. The exact split depends on the project and your contribution, but it's real money for real work.

When the project ends, you have something most builders never get: Proof. Actual shipped software for an actual paying client. Not a tutorial project. Not a side project nobody saw. Something real.

And if you want to keep going, you stay in for the next project. Same deal. Keep shipping, keep earning, keep learning.

Now here's who this is NOT for.

If you need hand-holding, this isn't it. I'll guide you. I'll review your work. But I'm not going to sit with you for eight hours explaining basic concepts. You need to be able to figure things out.

If you can't commit time, this isn't it. Client projects have deadlines. If you disappear for two weeks, that's a problem.

If you just want a certificate or a credential, this isn't it. You get results. You get portfolio pieces. You get money. You don't get a PDF that says you completed something.

But if you're tired of fake projects. If you're tired of learning without earning. If you want to actually get in the room and do the work...

This is how you get experience without needing experience first.

Apply below. Tell me what you've built, what you want to build, and why you're ready.

I'll review every application personally. If it's a fit, we'll talk.

If not, I'll tell you what to work on first.

Let's build something real.
