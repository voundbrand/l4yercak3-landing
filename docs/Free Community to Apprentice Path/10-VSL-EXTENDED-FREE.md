## Script

```
Here's what nobody tells you about vibe coding: Building is the easy part.

Every day, thousands of people are shipping apps, automations, and AI tools faster than ever. The barrier to building is basically gone. But here's the problem - 90% of these projects end up in the same place. The graveyard of side projects that never made a dollar.

I know this because I spent 20 years as that guy. Building enterprise systems, shipping real software, watching my code run businesses. I could build anything. But when I tried to go solo? I couldn't sell any of it.

So in 2019, I did something most technical founders are too proud to do. I stopped coding completely. For five years, I learned the dark arts of sales and marketing. Cold outreach, positioning, pricing psychology, objection handling - the stuff that actually turns projects into paychecks.

And what I discovered changed everything.

The gap isn't your code. It's everything that happens after you build it. While you're tweaking features nobody asked for, your competitors are making money with worse products and better sales systems.

So here's what I do now. I help vibe coders and AI builders do two things: finish and sell.

Not theory. Not another course you'll never complete. Actual execution.

I built a free community for builders who are serious about shipping.

Here's what you get:

Templates and frameworks for everything from finding customers to pricing your work. The stuff that took me years to figure out.

Other builders who are actually doing the work. Not lurkers. Not dreamers. People who ship.

A level system that rewards participation. The more you engage, the more you unlock. Office hours clips, advanced templates, early access to new tools.

And if you want to go faster, there's premium tiers with direct access to me. Office hours, monthly calls, feedback on your actual projects.

But start with free. See if this is your kind of place.

And if you're really serious - if you're tired of fake projects and want to work on real client software with me - there's an apprenticeship program. You pay to get in, you work on actual client projects, and you get paid when we deliver. Real experience, real portfolio, real money.

But that's for later. First, join the community.

Here's who this is for:

You can build things, or you're learning to. You've got projects that never shipped, or shipped but never sold. You're tired of collecting tutorials and ready to start collecting customers.

Here's who this is NOT for:

If you need someone to hold your hand every step, this isn't it. If you're looking for get-rich-quick schemes, this isn't it. If you just want to lurk and never participate, don't bother.

This community is for builders. People who do the work.

If that's you, click the link. Join for free. Introduce yourself. Tell us what you're building.

Let's ship something that actually makes money.
