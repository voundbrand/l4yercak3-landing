# Pain Points - Vibe Coder ICP

## The Core Problem
Vibe coders can BUILD but they can't SELL. They're stuck in the build trap.

---

## Pain Point Categories

### 1. The "I Built It, Now What?" Problem
- Built a product nobody asked for
- Launched to crickets
- "Every day I say, maybe I need to add a feature or make the mobile app, but I know this is not the right thing to do; I need to find people who want it"
- After 4 months of coding, launched on Product Hunt, Indie Hackers, Twitter, Reddit - got nothing
- Built a nice-to-have, not a must-have

### 2. Marketing Feels Alien
- "Developers are great at building stuff but struggle with marketing"
- "They love building, not promoting"
- "Chasing potential customers doesn't feel right"
- Marketing feels like storytelling mixed with psychology - "domains that weren't covered in computer science curriculum"
- 90% time building, 10% time marketing (should be 50/50)
- Technical communication style doesn't translate - can explain algorithms but can't write compelling copy

### 3. Sales is Terrifying
- "Cold calling is frightening if you're an introverted engineer"
- When they quit their job to build a product, they actually made "a job change from 'really pretty good engineer to full time sales guy'"
- Don't know how to prospect, drill into pain points, find decision makers
- "It's not easy"

### 4. The Build Trap / Comfort Zone
- When there are no users, they assume they haven't built the right feature yet
- So they build MORE features nobody wants instead of going out and finding customers
- Building is easy (for them). Finding customers is hard.
- "Software engineers might stick with what's comfortable, trying to suppress problems in areas like marketing and finance"
- Keep infinitely improving software instead of expanding network

### 5. Vibe Coding Specific Problems
- "Random things are happening, maxed out usage on API keys, people bypassing the subscription, creating random shit on db"
- "Cursor keeps breaking other parts of the code"
- Can build fast but create "shaky foundations"
- "As you add another floor, and another floor, things start to crumble"
- Up to 40% of AI-generated code is vulnerable to SQL injection
- Can't debug when AI-generated code fails
- No architecture understanding
- "Legacy code immediately" because they don't understand what they built

### 6. Burnout from Wearing All Hats
- "You have to do everything (including sh**t you don't like) - coding, support, marketing, accounting, video shooting and editing"
- Get paid less while working more
- "Most solo developers end up burnt out, broke, and going back to their corporate job in a few months"
- 80% of programmers feel burned out
- Burn out from unclear priorities and constant interruptions, not from coding

### 7. The Validation Gap
- Build first, ask questions later (wrong order)
- "Building something nobody wants" is the #1 mistake
- #1 cause of startup failure = no market need
- Keep adding features hoping users finally see value
- Built a product solving a problem that didn't exist
- The apps people actually buy are "small, simple, painfully practical" - not elaborate dashboards

### 8. The Indie Hacker Echo Chamber
- "99% chance you're going to end up building products for other indiehackers"
- "Fellow creators and peers are not your target audience"
- Building in public attracts copycats, not customers
- Successful indie hackers disappearing into "revenue ghost mode" to avoid being copied

### 9. The Trust Problem
- "Why should strangers trust me with their money?"
- Can't compete with established players on features
- Don't have case studies or social proof yet
- First customer is hardest - "getting that first rube to part with their money over your barely-minimum barely-viable product"

### 10. Unrealistic Expectations
- Influencers don't show "the months they made $0 while working 12hr days"
- Most profitable products from famous indie hackers are courses about how to code - not actual SaaS
- Underestimate the effort, overestimate how easy it will be
- Think "if they build a great product, people will see it and buy it"

## Emotional States

### Frustration
- "I felt like a failure"
- "Maybe I wasn't cut out for SaaS"
- "Poured months into something nobody wanted"

### Fear
- Fear of rejection (cold calling, putting themselves out there)
- Fear of looking stupid
- Fear of not being technical enough (for non-devs) OR not being business-savvy enough (for devs)

### Overwhelm
- Too many things to learn
- Too many hats to wear
- No clear path forward

### Imposter Syndrome
- "Real" entrepreneurs seem to have figured this out
- Everyone else seems to be succeeding on social media
- Feel behind

### Desperation
- Running out of runway
- Considering going back to corporate job
- Will try anything to get traction

## What They've Tried (That Didn't Work)

1. Adding more features
2. Making it prettier
3. Launching on Product Hunt (to other indie hackers)
4. Posting in Reddit (and getting downvoted/banned)
5. Building in public (attracting copycats, not customers)
6. Paid ads without understanding targeting
7. Trying to copy what worked for someone else
