### Section 1: The Problem

```
You've taken the courses. Built the to-do apps. Followed the tutorials.

And when you try to land clients or get hired, you hear the same thing:

"Do you have experience with real projects?"

No. Because nobody let you work on real projects.

You can't get experience without experience. So you stay stuck. More tutorials. More fake projects. More waiting.
```

---

### Section 2: The Apprenticeship

```
This is different.

You don't learn from me. You work with me.

When I land a client project - lead gen systems, automations, SaaS builds - you're on the team. Real tasks. Real deadlines. Real stakes.

You ship software that businesses pay for. You see how I scope, communicate, and deliver. And when we get paid, you get paid.
```

### Section 3: How It Works

**Step 1: Apply**
Fill out the application. Show me what you've built. Tell me why you're ready.

**Step 2: Pay €5,000 to join**
This is your skin in the game. It tells me you're serious.

**Step 3: Join the next project**
Could be days, could be weeks. Depends on the pipeline. You'll know what's coming.

**Step 4: Ship real software**
Daily communication. Real tasks. Real deliverables. I guide, you build.

**Step 5: Get paid**
When the client pays, you get a revenue share. Real money for real work.

**Step 6: Repeat or move on**
Stay for more projects, or take your portfolio and go land your own clients. Either way, you leave with proof.

### Section 4: What You Get

- ✅ Real client projects (not tutorials, not fake apps)
- ✅ Daily access to me during projects
- ✅ Revenue share on everything you help ship
- ✅ Portfolio pieces that actually matter
- ✅ Reference/endorsement when you're ready to go solo

---

### Section 5: What You Don't Get

- ❌ Hand-holding (I guide, I don't babysit)
- ❌ A certificate (you get results, not PDFs)
- ❌ Guaranteed hours (project-based, not employment)
- ❌ Theory (we're shipping, not lecturing)

---

### Section 6: Who This Is For

- You can already build (or you're close)
- You've shipped something, even if small
- You can commit 10-20+ hours/week
- You're tired of learning without earning
- You want experience, not another course

---

### Section 7: Who This Is NOT For

- Complete beginners (you need basics first)
- People who need constant validation
- Anyone who disappears when things get hard
- Credential collectors

---

### Section 8: The Investment

**€5,000** to join.

Plus revenue share on projects you help deliver.

Your €5K could come back on the first project. Definitely by the second.

---

### Section 9: FAQ

**Q: What kind of projects will I work on?**
A: Varies based on client pipeline. Could be lead gen systems, automations, SaaS MVPs, internal tools. You'll know what's coming before you start.

**Q: How much time do I need to commit?**
A: 10-20+ hours per week during active projects. Some weeks more, some weeks less. Client deadlines dictate the pace.

**Q: What's the revenue share percentage?**
A: Depends on the project and your contribution. We'll agree on terms before each project starts. Typical range is 10-20%.

**Q: What if I'm not ready?**
A: I'll tell you. If your application shows you need more fundamentals, I'll point you to resources and invite you to reapply later.

**Q: Can I stay for multiple projects?**
A: Yes. Many apprentices stay for 2-3+ projects. Each project is a new agreement.

**Q: What happens after?**
A: You leave with portfolio pieces, my endorsement, and the skills to land your own clients. Some apprentices have gone on to build six-figure practices.
