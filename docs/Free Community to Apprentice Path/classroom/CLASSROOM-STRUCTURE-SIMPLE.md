# Classroom Structure (Simplified)

Based on Perfect Webinar framework + ICP research. Each video breaks a specific false belief.

## The 3 False Beliefs (from ICP Research)

| Belief | What They Think | The Truth |
|--------|-----------------|-----------|
| **Vehicle** | "I just need the right idea / more features" | Building is the easy part. Validation and selling are the gaps. |
| **Internal** | "I'm not a marketing/sales person" | Marketing is communication. Sales is conversations. You can learn. |
| **External** | "The market is saturated / I can't compete" | You're building for other builders. Real customers are elsewhere. |

## Module 1: Start Here

| # | Title | Length | Belief Broken | CTA |
|---|-------|--------|---------------|-----|
| 1 | Watch This First | 2-3 min | Origin Story - credibility | Watch video 2 |
| 2 | Building Is the Easy Part | 3-4 min | Vehicle: "I need a better idea" | Watch video 3 |
| 3 | You're Not a Salesperson (Good) | 2-3 min | Internal: "I'm not a marketing person" | Upgrade to Premium |
| 4 | The Apprenticeship | 4-5 min | External: "I can't get experience" | Apply |

### Video 1: Watch This First (Origin Story)

**Purpose:** Establish credibility. Show you were where they are.

**Hook:** "If you can build anything but can't get anyone to pay for it - welcome home."

**Structure:**
- Your story: 20 years building software. Could build anything.
- The gap: Tried to go solo. Couldn't sell any of it.
- The pivot: Stopped coding for 5 years. Learned sales and marketing.
- The realization: The gap isn't technical. It's everything else.
- What this community is: Builders learning to ship AND sell
- CTA: "Next video: why building is actually your problem, not your advantage"

---

### Video 2: Building Is the Easy Part (Vehicle Story)

**Purpose:** Break the "I just need to build the right thing" belief.

**Hook:** "AI made building easy. Nobody tells you that's the problem."

**Structure:**
- The old world: Building was hard. If you could code, you had an advantage.
- The new world: Anyone can ship an MVP in a weekend. Cursor writes your code. V0 generates your UI.
- The shift: Building is no longer the competitive advantage. EVERYONE can build now.
- The new gaps:
  1. Validation (building things people actually want)
  2. Positioning (being found by the right people)
  3. Selling (converting attention into money)
- The indie hacker trap: You're building for other builders, launching on Product Hunt to get upvotes from people who will never buy
- The new opportunity: Learn the skills that actually differentiate now
- CTA: "Next video: the belief that's really holding you back"

**Key ICP Pain Points to Hit:**
- "I built it, now what?" problem
- Launched to crickets
- Adding features hoping users see value
- 90% building, 10% marketing

### Video 3: You're Not a Salesperson (Good) - Internal Belief

**Purpose:** Break "I'm not a marketing/sales person" belief. Upgrade to Premium.

**Hook:** "I'm not a marketing person" - every developer who's failing

**Structure:**
- The false belief: "Marketing is sleazy. Sales is manipulative. I'm a builder, not a hustler."
- Why they believe it: Seen bad marketing. Spam. Hype. Fake gurus.
- The cost: Good products die in silence while mediocre products with marketing win
- The reframe:
  - Marketing is just clear communication about how you help
  - Sales is just conversations about problems and solutions
  - You're already doing both - you're just doing them badly
- Your story: "I was a developer who couldn't sell. Thought it was beneath me. Learned the hard way."
- The shift: You don't need to become someone else. You need to learn a skill.
- What Premium gives them: Templates, frameworks, scripts - so they don't start from zero
- What VIP gives them: Direct feedback, office hours, accountability
- CTA: "If you're ready to learn the skills that actually matter now → Upgrade"

**Key ICP Pain Points to Hit:**
- "Cold calling is frightening"
- Marketing feels like psychology they never learned
- Technical communication style doesn't translate
- "I'm not a salesperson"

**This is the upgrade pitch video.**

### Video 4: The Apprenticeship (External Belief)

**Purpose:** Break "I can't get experience without experience" belief. Pitch apprenticeship.

**Hook:** "Do you have experience with real projects?" The catch-22 that keeps you stuck.

**Structure:**
- The external barrier: Can't get experience without experience
- What they've tried: Courses, tutorials, fake projects, portfolio pieces nobody looks at
- Why it doesn't work: Learning by watching ≠ learning by doing
- The truth: It clicks from shipping, not from watching
- The solution: Work on REAL client projects WITH me
- How it works: €5K, join active projects, revenue share, actual shipped software
- What you get: Proof. Portfolio. Money. References.
- Who it's for: Builders who can already build, ready to stop practicing
- Who it's NOT for: Hand-holders, people who can't commit time
- CTA: "Apply below"

**Reuse:** `04-VSL-APPRENTICESHIP.md`

**Key ICP Pain Points to Hit:**
- "Why should strangers trust me?"
- No case studies or social proof yet
- First customer is the hardest
- Courses don't translate to real experience
