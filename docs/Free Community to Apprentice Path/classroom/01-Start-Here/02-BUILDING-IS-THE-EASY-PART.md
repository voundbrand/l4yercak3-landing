## Script Outline

### The Old World (30 sec)

Five years ago, if you could code, you had an advantage.

Building was hard. Most people couldn't do it. If you could ship a working product, you were ahead of 90% of the market.

That world is gone.

### The New World (45 sec)

Now anyone can ship an MVP in a weekend.

Cursor writes your code. V0 generates your UI. Claude debugs your errors. You can go from idea to deployed product before lunch.

Building is no longer the competitive advantage. Everyone can build now.

So what happens? You launch. Crickets. You add features. Still nothing. You think "maybe I need a better idea" and start over.

Sound familiar?

### The Real Gaps (60 sec)

The problem isn't your idea. The problem isn't your code.

The problem is you're missing the three things that actually matter now:

**One: Validation.**
You're building things nobody asked for. You assume people want it instead of proving they do.

**Two: Positioning.**
Nobody can find you. Or when they do, they don't understand why you're different.

**Three: Selling.**
You don't know how to turn attention into money. You hope the product sells itself. It doesn't.

These are skills. They can be learned. But nobody teaches them to builders.

### The Indie Hacker Trap (45 sec)

Here's the trap most builders fall into:

You "build in public." You get followers. You launch on Product Hunt. You get upvotes.

But look at who's following you. Look at who's upvoting.

Other builders. Other indie hackers. People who will never buy your product.

You're performing for an audience that can't pay you.

Real customers don't hang out where builders hang out. And you're not going to find them by posting your progress on Twitter.

### CTA (15 sec)

So what do you do about it?

Next video, I'm going to tell you about the belief that's actually holding you back.

It's probably not what you think.
