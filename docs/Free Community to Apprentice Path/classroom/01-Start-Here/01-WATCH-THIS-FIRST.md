## Script Outline

### The Story (90 sec)

I spent 20 years building software. Enterprise systems, real products, stuff businesses depend on.

I could build anything. That was never the problem.

The problem came when I tried to go solo. I built things. Good things. And I couldn't sell any of them.

So I stopped coding. For five years, I stepped away from development and learned the other side - sales, marketing, positioning, outreach. The stuff that turns projects into paychecks.

And I realized something: The gap isn't technical. It's everything else.

Most builders are stuck in the same place I was. They can build. They just can't sell.

### What This Community Is (30 sec)

This community is for builders who want to close that gap.

Not lurkers. Not people who want to watch from the sidelines. People who are ready to ship AND sell.

You'll level up by participating. You'll unlock templates and resources as you go. And if you're serious about going faster, there's Premium and VIP tiers that give you direct access to the systems I use.

### CTA (15 sec)

Next video: I'm going to tell you why building is actually your problem now, not your advantage.

It's not what you expect. Watch it.
