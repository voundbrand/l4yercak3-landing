## Hook

"I'm not a marketing person."

That's what every failing developer says.

---

## Script Outline

### The False Belief (30 sec)

You think marketing is sleazy. Sales is manipulative. You're a builder, not a hustler.

You've seen the bad stuff. The spam. The hype. The fake gurus selling dreams.

And you think: "That's not me. I just want to build good products."

So you avoid it. You hope the product speaks for itself.

### The Cost (30 sec)

It doesn't.

Good products die in silence every single day. Meanwhile, mediocre products with good marketing win.

You know this. You've seen it. And it frustrates you.

But here's the thing - that frustration is costing you. Every month you avoid learning this stuff is another month of zero revenue.

### The Reframe (45 sec)

What if I told you marketing isn't what you think it is?

Marketing is just clear communication about how you help people.

Sales is just conversations about problems and solutions.

You're already doing both. You explain your code to teammates. You write documentation. You convince people to use your libraries.

You're just doing it badly when it comes to your own products - because you never learned how.

### The Shift (30 sec)

I was the same way. Developer who couldn't sell. Thought it was beneath me.

Then I spent five years learning it. And I realized: this is a skill. Like any other skill. You can learn it without becoming someone you're not.

You don't need to be pushy. You don't need to be fake. You just need to learn how to communicate value.

### The Pitch (30 sec)

That's what Premium is for.

Templates. Frameworks. Scripts. The stuff that took me years to figure out.

ICP worksheets so you know who to target. Outreach scripts so you know what to say. Pricing frameworks so you stop undercharging.

You don't start from zero. You start from what works.

VIP gets you direct access - office hours twice a month, feedback on your actual projects.

### CTA (15 sec)

If you're ready to learn the skills that actually matter now, upgrade to Premium.

And if you want to skip the line entirely - work on real client projects with me, get paid real money - watch the next video about the Apprenticeship.

## Key ICP Pain Points to Hit
