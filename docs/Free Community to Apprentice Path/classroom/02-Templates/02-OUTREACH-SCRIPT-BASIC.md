## What This Is

A simple cold DM framework. Not spammy. Just clear communication about how you can help.

---

## The Framework: PAS + CTA

**P - Problem:** Lead with their pain
**A - Agitate:** Show you understand the cost
**S - Solution:** What you do (briefly)
**CTA:** One clear next step

---

## Template

```
Hey [Name],

[PROBLEM - observation about their situation]

[AGITATE - the cost of that problem]

[SOLUTION - what you do, one sentence]

[CTA - simple ask]

[Your name]
```

---

## Example: LinkedIn DM

```
Hey Sarah,

Noticed you're running marketing for [Company] - saw the team is growing fast.

When teams scale, reporting usually becomes a nightmare. Everyone uses different tools, nobody has the full picture, and someone ends up spending hours in spreadsheets every week.

I build automated dashboards that pull everything into one place - usually takes about 48 hours to set up.

Worth a quick chat to see if it'd help?

## Why This Works

1. **Personalized observation** - shows you did research
2. **Problem they recognize** - not pitching, just describing their life
3. **Light agitation** - reminds them of the cost
4. **Simple solution** - one sentence, not a sales pitch
5. **Low-friction CTA** - "worth a quick chat" not "book a call"

---

## Common Mistakes

- Too long (keep it under 100 words)
- Talking about yourself instead of them
- No clear CTA
- Asking for too much ("hop on a 30-min call")
- Copy-paste obvious (no personalization)
