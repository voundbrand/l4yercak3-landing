## About Page Description

```
Ship it. Sell it. Stop starting over.

For vibe coders and AI builders who are tired of fake projects and zero revenue.

You don't have a skills problem. You have a finishing problem. And a selling problem.

This community is for builders who want to:
✅ Actually ship what they're building
✅ Learn to sell it (not just build it)
✅ Get around other people who are doing the work

I'm Remington. 20 years building software. 5 years selling it. Now I help builders ship and get paid.

🏆 Level up to unlock templates, office hours, and more.

🚀 Serious about going faster? Check out the Premium tier or apply for the Apprenticeship.
