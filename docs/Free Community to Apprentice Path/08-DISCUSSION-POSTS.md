## Week 1

### Day 1 (Launch Day)

**Post 1: Welcome + Introduce Yourself**
*(Pin this post)*

See `09-WELCOME-POST.md` for full content.

---

**Post 2: Poll - What's Your Biggest Blocker?**

```
Quick poll 👇

What's the #1 thing stopping you from shipping and making money?

A) I can't finish what I start
B) I don't know what to build
C) I build but can't sell
D) I sell but can't deliver consistently
E) Something else (comment below)

Drop your answer. I'm genuinely curious where everyone's stuck.
```

### Day 2

**Post 3: Hot Take**

```
Hot take: The best developers I know are mediocre at coding.

They're great at:
- Understanding what clients actually need
- Scoping projects so they don't explode
- Communicating when things go wrong
- Shipping 80% solutions fast

The worst developers I know write beautiful code that nobody uses.

Agree or disagree?
```

### Day 3

**Post 4: Value Post - The Graveyard**

```
Let's talk about the graveyard.

You know the one. The folder on your computer with:
- That app you started 6 months ago
- The SaaS idea you "validated" but never launched
- The automation you built for yourself but never productized
- The course you started making

Every builder has one. Most pretend they don't.

Here's what I've learned: The graveyard isn't the problem. Starting is good. The problem is WHY things end up there.

Usually it's one of three reasons:
1. You got bored (the idea wasn't compelling enough)
2. You got stuck (technical or business blocker you couldn't solve)
3. You got scared (shipping means people can judge it)

Which one is your biggest graveyard filler? Be honest.

### Day 4

**Post 5: Engagement Prompt**

```
Reply with ONE project you're working on right now.

Just one. In one sentence.

I'll pick 3 and give quick feedback tomorrow.
```

---

### Day 5

**Post 6: Follow-Up (Feedback Post)**

```
Yesterday I asked for projects. Here's feedback on 3:

@[Name1] - [Project]: [Feedback]

@[Name2] - [Project]: [Feedback]

@[Name3] - [Project]: [Feedback]

Want this kind of feedback regularly? That's what office hours are for in the VIP tier. But I'll do these occasionally for everyone.

Keep building.
```

---

### Day 6

**Post 7: Framework Share**

```
The 3-Question Validation Test

Before you build anything, answer these:

1. Who has this problem? (Specific person, not "everyone")
2. How are they solving it today? (There's always a current solution)
3. Would they pay to solve it better? (Not "would they like it" - would they PAY)

If you can't answer all three clearly, you're not ready to build.

If you CAN answer all three, share them below. Let's pressure test.
```

---

### Day 7

**Post 8: Weekend Challenge**

```
Weekend micro-challenge:

Find ONE Reddit thread where someone is complaining about a problem you could solve.

Screenshot it. Post it here. Tell us:
- What's the problem?
- What would you build?
- How much would you charge?

Best answer gets featured next week.

Go hunt. 🎯
```

---

## Week 2

### Day 8

**Post 9: Showcase (Weekend Challenge Results)**

```
Weekend challenge results 🏆

[X] people posted Reddit finds. Here are my favorites:

🥇 @[Name] - [Problem/Solution summary]
[Why this is good]

🥈 @[Name] - [Problem/Solution summary]
[Why this is good]

🥉 @[Name] - [Problem/Solution summary]
[Why this is good]

This is how you find real problems to solve. Not guessing. Finding.

More challenges coming. Stay active.
```

### Day 9

**Post 10: Hot Take #2**

```
Unpopular opinion: "Validate before you build" is bad advice for most people.

Here's why:

If you're a builder, building IS your validation. You learn more from shipping a crappy v1 than from 100 customer interviews.

The advice should be: "Build the smallest possible thing, ship it fast, and see if anyone cares."

Validation is for people with money to spend on research. Builders validate by building.

Fight me. 👇

### Day 10

**Post 11: Resource Drop**

```
Template drop: The ICP Research Worksheet 📋

This is the exact worksheet I use to figure out who I'm building for.

It's unlocked at Level 2 in the classroom.

Not Level 2 yet? Easy fix - introduce yourself, comment on a few posts, help someone with a question. You'll be there in no time.

Link to classroom: [LINK]
```

### Day 11

**Post 12: Story Post**

```
Story time.

First project I ever tried to sell: A booking system for hair salons.

I spent 3 months building it. Beautiful code. Clean UI. All the features.

Tried to sell it for 6 months. Got exactly 0 customers.

Why? I never talked to a hair salon owner before building. I assumed I knew what they needed. I was wrong.

The features I was proud of? They didn't care. The one thing they actually needed? I didn't build it.

Lesson: Build WITH people, not FOR people.

What's your "I built the wrong thing" story?
```

---

### Day 12

**Post 13: Poll - Pricing**

```
Pricing question:

You build a simple automation for a client. Takes you 4 hours. Saves them 10 hours/month.

How much do you charge?

A) €200-500 (hourly rate thinking)
B) €500-1000 (project rate)
C) €1000-2000 (value-based)
D) €2000+ (premium positioning)
E) Monthly retainer

Answer below + explain your logic.

No wrong answers - but some are more profitable than others. 💰
```

### Day 13

**Post 14: Challenge Tease**

```
Coming next week: First official Build Challenge 🏗️

Here's how it works:
- I post a brief (real problem, real constraints)
- You have 7 days to build a solution
- Community votes on winners
- Winners get featured + prizes

To participate, you need to be Level 5 (Sous Chef 🧑‍🍳).

Not there yet? Get active this weekend. Plenty of time.

Details dropping Monday.
```

### Day 14

**Post 15: Week 2 Wrap**

```
Week 2 wrap-up.

We've got [X] members now. Here's what I've noticed:

🔥 [Positive observation about community activity]
🔥 [Another positive observation]
🔥 [Shoutout to active member(s)]

What I'd like to see more of:
- People sharing what they're building
- Members helping each other (not just waiting for me)
- Real questions, not generic ones

This community is what we make it. The more you put in, the more you get out.

See you next week. Build something.
