## Before You Start: Define Your 3 False Beliefs

From your ICP research, identify the 3 beliefs holding your audience back:

### 1. Vehicle Belief (Video 2)
**What they think:** [The method/approach/tool doesn't work]
**The truth:** [Why your vehicle IS the answer]

### 2. Internal Belief (Video 3)
**What they think:** [I'm not capable / ready / qualified]
**The truth:** [Why they CAN do this]

### 3. External Belief (Video 4)
**What they think:** [The market / economy / circumstances won't allow it]
**The truth:** [Why external factors don't matter / how to overcome]

## Offer Mapping

Map your beliefs to your offers:

| Video | Belief | Offer |
|-------|--------|-------|
| 1 | - | Free (just watch next video) |
| 2 | Vehicle | Free (just watch next video) |
| 3 | Internal | Mid-ticket (Premium, course, etc.) |
| 4 | External | High-ticket (Coaching, done-for-you, etc.) |

The internal belief video sells your main offer.
The external belief video sells your premium/high-ticket offer.

## Tips

- Keep videos short (2-5 min each)
- Each video ends with ONE clear CTA
- Use your ICP's exact language (from research)
