## Formatting Notes

- Use the "---" dividers for visual separation
- Emojis help with scanability
- Keep sections short
- End with clear CTA (introduce yourself)
- Pin this post so it's always at the top

## Comment Response Template

When someone introduces themselves, respond with something like:

```
Welcome [Name]! 

[Specific comment about their project/challenge]

[One piece of advice or encouragement]

Make sure you check out the Classroom - start with the first video.
```

Keep responses personal, not copy-paste. People can tell.
