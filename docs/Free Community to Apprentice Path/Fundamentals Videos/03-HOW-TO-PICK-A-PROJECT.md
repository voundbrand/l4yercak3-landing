## Purpose

Make project selection practical. Give them a filter they can use immediately. Kill the "what should I build?" paralysis.

## Outline

### Hook (30 sec)

The graveyard isn't full of bad ideas. It's full of ideas that were never worth finishing in the first place.

Here's how to pick projects you'll actually complete - and get paid for.

### The Wrong Way to Pick Projects (1 min)

Most builders pick projects based on:

- "This sounds cool"
- "I want to learn this technology"
- "I saw someone on Twitter do well with this"
- "I have this problem, maybe others do too"

None of these are reasons to build something.

They're reasons to start something. Starting isn't the problem.

### The Filter: Market Signals (2 min)

Before you build anything, look for market signals.

**Market signals = evidence that people want this AND will pay for it.**

Where to find them:

1. **Reddit/forums** - People complaining about a problem, asking for solutions
2. **Existing products** - Something already sells, but has gaps or angry customers
3. **Your past clients/work** - Someone already paid you for something adjacent
4. **Direct conversations** - You asked people and they said "I'd pay for that"

If you can't find a market signal, don't build it.

"I think people might want this" is not a market signal. That's a guess.

### The Scope Test (1-2 min)

Even good ideas die when they're scoped wrong.

Ask yourself: **Can I build a useful v1 in 2 weeks or less?**

If no, you've scoped too big. Cut features until the answer is yes.

What's a "useful v1"?
- It solves the core problem
- Someone would pay for it as-is
- It's not embarrassing (but it's also not perfect)

The goal isn't to build everything. It's to build the minimum that someone will pay for - then improve based on feedback.

**Scope creep kills more projects than lack of skill.**

### The Money Path (1 min)

Before you start, answer: **How does this make money?**

Options:
- One-time sale (you build it, they pay once)
- Retainer/subscription (ongoing fee)
- Productized service (you sell your time, but packaged)
- Lead magnet (free thing that leads to paid thing)

If you can't clearly see the money path, you'll build something and then scramble to monetize. That rarely works.

Decide the business model BEFORE you build.

### When to Kill a Project (1 min)

Sometimes you pick wrong. That's fine. Kill it fast.

Kill a project when:
- You've been "almost done" for more than 2 weeks
- Nobody's responded to your outreach about it
- You're only working on it out of guilt
- The market signal disappeared or was weaker than you thought

Killing projects isn't failure. It's clearing space for projects worth finishing.

The graveyard isn't the problem. Staying too long in the graveyard is.

### The Checklist (30 sec)

Before your next project, run it through this:

1. Is there a market signal? (Evidence people want it + will pay)
2. Can I scope a useful v1 in 2 weeks?
3. Do I know exactly how this makes money?

Yes to all three? Build it.

No to any? Don't start until you fix it.

### Close (30 sec)

That's the fundamentals. Why builders fail, the three things you need, and how to pick what to build.

Now go use it.

If you want templates to help with the offer and outreach system pieces - ICP worksheets, outreach scripts, pricing frameworks - that's what Premium unlocks.

But you have enough to start. Pick a project. Ship it. Sell it.

See you in the community.

## Key Points to Hit

- Wrong reasons to pick projects (cool, learning, guessing)
- Market signals = evidence, not assumptions
- Scope test: useful v1 in 2 weeks or less
- Know the money path before building
- When and how to kill projects
- The 3-question checklist

## Tone

- Practical, tactical
- "Here's exactly what to do"
- Permission to kill projects
- Soft pitch to Premium at the end (not pushy)

## Visuals (Optional)

- The 3-question checklist as graphic
- Examples of market signals (Reddit screenshots, etc.)
- Keep it simple

## CTA

Soft mention of Premium templates. No hard sell - they just finished valuable free content, reward that with a gentle nudge.
