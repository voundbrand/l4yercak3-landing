## Purpose

Give them the framework. These are the three pillars that turn a builder into someone who gets paid. Simple, memorable, actionable.

## Outline

### Hook (30 sec)

Last video I told you about the two gaps - finishing and selling.

Now I'm going to give you the three things you need to close them.

Not 47 things. Not a 12-week system. Three things.

### Thing 1: A Project Worth Finishing (2 min)

Most of your projects died because they weren't worth finishing.

A project worth finishing has three qualities:

1. **Someone wants it** - Not "might want it." Actually wants it. You've seen evidence.
2. **You can scope it** - You can build a useful v1 in days or weeks, not months.
3. **You'll get paid** - There's a clear path to money, not just "maybe I'll monetize later."

If your project doesn't have all three, you'll abandon it. Every time.

Stop picking projects based on what's interesting. Start picking projects based on what's finishable and sellable.

### Thing 2: An Offer (2 min)

You don't sell products. You sell offers.

An offer is: the transformation + the terms.

- What outcome does the buyer get?
- How much does it cost?
- What's included?
- What's the risk reversal?

Most builders skip this entirely. They build something and say "here it is, pay me."

That's not an offer. That's hoping.

A real offer answers every question the buyer has before they ask it. It makes saying yes easy.

**Example:**
- Bad: "I built an automation tool for $500"
- Good: "I'll automate your lead follow-up so you never lose a deal to slow response time. $500, done in 48 hours, or you don't pay."

Same thing. Completely different offer.

### Thing 3: A System to Reach Buyers (2 min)

You need a way to consistently get in front of people who can pay.

Not:
- Random posts on Twitter
- Hoping for referrals
- "Building in public" and praying

A system means:
- You know exactly who you're targeting (ICP)
- You have a way to reach them (outreach, content, partnerships)
- You do it consistently, not when you feel like it

Most builders have zero system. They build in isolation, then wonder why nobody buys.

The system doesn't have to be complicated. It has to exist.

### The Framework (30 sec)

That's it. Three things:

1. A project worth finishing
2. An offer (not just a product)
3. A system to reach buyers

If you're missing any one of these, you won't make money. All three have to be there.

### Transition (30 sec)

Next video, I'm going to go deep on #1 - how to pick a project worth finishing.

Because that's where most builders mess up first. They pick wrong, then everything else falls apart.

See you there.

## Key Points to Hit

- Three things, not complicated
- Project worth finishing = wanted + scopeable + path to money
- Offer = transformation + terms (not just a product)
- System = consistent way to reach buyers
- All three required, missing one breaks it

## Tone

- Teaching mode
- Confident, clear
- Examples help
- Building momentum toward next video

## Visuals (Optional)

- Simple graphic showing the 3 things
- Before/after on the offer example
- Keep it clean
