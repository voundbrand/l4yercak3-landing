## Purpose

Transform their thinking from "I built a thing" to "I have an offer." This is where most technical builders completely fall apart - they don't know how to package what they build.

## Outline

### Hook (30 sec)

You don't sell products. You sell offers.

Most builders finish something and say "here it is, give me money." That's not an offer. That's hoping.

Here's how to build an offer people actually say yes to.

### Product vs. Offer (1-2 min)

**A product is what you built.**
**An offer is the deal you're making.**

Product: "I made an automation that sends follow-up emails."

Offer: "I'll set up an automated follow-up system that makes sure you never lose a lead to slow response time. $750, done in 3 days, includes 30 days of support. If it doesn't save you at least 5 hours a week, I'll refund you."

Same product. Completely different conversion rate.

The offer answers every question before they ask:
- What do I get?
- What's the outcome?
- How much?
- How long?
- What if it doesn't work?

### The 5 Parts of an Offer (3 min)

**1. The Outcome (not the deliverable)**

Don't sell what you're building. Sell what it does for them.

- Bad: "A custom CRM integration"
- Good: "Never manually enter lead data again"

They don't care about the integration. They care about not doing manual work.

**2. The Price**

Pick a number. Don't say "it depends" or "let's discuss."

Your price should be:
- High enough that you're motivated to deliver
- Low enough that it's not a major decision for them
- Specific (not a range)

If you're new, start lower to get reps. Raise it once you have proof.

**3. The Timeline**

When do they get it? Be specific.

- "Done in 48 hours"
- "Delivered by Friday"
- "2-week turnaround"

Vague timelines kill deals. People want to know when they'll have the thing.

**4. What's Included (and What's Not)**

Scope creep happens because you didn't define boundaries.

Be explicit:
- "Includes: X, Y, Z"
- "Does not include: A, B, C"
- "Revisions: 2 rounds included"

This protects you AND makes them feel clear about what they're buying.

**5. The Risk Reversal**

Remove the fear of saying yes.

Options:
- Money-back guarantee
- "Pay after delivery"
- "If it doesn't do X, I'll fix it free"
- Milestone payments

The easier you make it to say yes, the more yeses you get.

### Putting It Together (1 min)

Here's a template:

"I'll [OUTCOME] for [PRICE]. Delivered in [TIMELINE]. Includes [SPECIFICS]. [RISK REVERSAL]."

Example:
"I'll build you an automated lead scoring system so your sales team only talks to qualified prospects. $1,200, delivered in 5 business days. Includes setup, testing, and a 15-minute training call. If it doesn't work as promised, I'll fix it or refund you."

That's an offer. Not "I can build stuff, hire me."

### Common Mistakes (1 min)

**Pricing too low** - You attract bad clients and resent the work. Price for motivation.

**No risk reversal** - You're asking them to trust a stranger. Make it easy.

**Selling features** - They don't care about features. They care about outcomes.

**Being vague** - "We can figure out the details later" means the deal falls apart later.

### Close (30 sec)

Take whatever you're building right now and run it through these 5 parts:

1. What's the outcome?
2. What's the price?
3. What's the timeline?
4. What's included (and not)?
5. What's the risk reversal?

Write it out. That's your offer.
