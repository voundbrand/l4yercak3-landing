## Purpose

Set the frame. Make them realize the problem isn't their skills - it's two gaps they've never addressed. This video creates the "aha" moment that makes them want the rest of the content.

## Outline

### Hook (30 sec)

You can build. That's not the problem.

The problem is you have a graveyard of unfinished projects and zero revenue. And you keep thinking the next tutorial, the next framework, the next idea will fix it.

It won't. Here's why.

### The Two Gaps (2-3 min)

**Gap 1: The Finishing Gap**

Most builders don't have a starting problem. They have a finishing problem.

- You start excited, hit a wall, get bored, move on
- You scope too big, lose momentum, abandon
- You build for yourself, not for anyone specific, so there's no urgency to ship

The graveyard isn't full of bad ideas. It's full of ideas that never got finished.

**Gap 2: The Selling Gap**

Even when you DO finish, you don't know how to sell it.

- You share it on Twitter, get 3 likes, give up
- You have no ICP, no outreach system, no offer
- You think "if I build it, they will come" - they won't

Building and selling are two completely different skills. Most builders only have one.

### Why Tutorials Don't Help (1-2 min)

Tutorials teach you to build things. They don't teach you to:

- Pick projects worth finishing
- Scope so you actually ship
- Package what you built into an offer
- Find people who will pay for it
- Close the sale

You can watch 1,000 hours of tutorials and still be broke. Because the gap isn't technical.

### The Real Difference (1 min)

The difference between hobbyists and professionals isn't talent.

It's this: Professionals ship. And then they sell what they ship.

That's it. They close the gaps.

### Transition (30 sec)

In the next video, I'm going to break down the three things you actually need to start making money from what you build.

Not more skills. Not more ideas. Three things.

See you there.

## Key Points to Hit

- The problem isn't their ability to build
- Two gaps: finishing and selling
- Tutorials don't address either gap
- Professionals close both gaps
- Tease the next video

## Tone

- Direct, no fluff
- Slightly confrontational (in a helpful way)
- Empathetic but honest
- "I've been there" energy

## Visuals (Optional)

- Could show "graveyard" graphic with project folders
- Simple text overlays for the two gaps
- Keep it minimal - talking head works fine
