## Purpose

Kill the "build it and they will come" delusion. Give them a simple, repeatable system for getting in front of buyers. This is where most builders give up - they don't know how to find people.

## Outline

### Hook (30 sec)

You've got a project worth finishing. You've got an offer. Now what?

Most builders post on Twitter, get 3 likes, and give up.

That's not a system. Here's what a system actually looks like.

### Why "Build in Public" Doesn't Work (1 min)

Let's kill this myth fast.

Building in public is great for:
- Accountability
- Meeting other builders
- Content

Building in public is terrible for:
- Finding paying customers
- Consistent revenue
- Anything resembling a sales pipeline

Your Twitter followers are other builders. They're not your buyers.

If your entire strategy is "post about what I'm building and hope someone reaches out" - that's not a strategy. That's a lottery ticket.

### What a System Actually Is (1 min)

A system has three parts:

1. **WHO** - A specific type of person (your ICP)
2. **WHERE** - A place you can reach them
3. **HOW** - A repeatable action you do consistently

That's it. WHO, WHERE, HOW.

If you're missing any of these, you don't have a system.

### Part 1: WHO (ICP) (1-2 min)

ICP = Ideal Customer Profile

This is the specific person who:
- Has the problem you solve
- Has money to pay for it
- Is reachable

Bad ICP: "Small businesses"
Good ICP: "Marketing agencies with 5-20 employees who are drowning in manual reporting"

The more specific, the better. You're not excluding people - you're making your message resonate with the right ones.

How to find your ICP:
- Who have you already helped (even for free)?
- Who's complaining about this problem online?
- Who's already paying for similar solutions?

Write it down: "[Type of person] who [specific situation/problem]"

### Part 2: WHERE (1-2 min)

Where do these people hang out? Where can you actually reach them?

Options:
- **LinkedIn** - Great for B2B, agencies, professionals
- **Reddit/forums** - Great for niche communities
- **Email** - If you can find their addresses
- **Communities** - Slack groups, Discord servers, Skool communities
- **Referrals** - People who know your ICP

Pick ONE. Don't try to be everywhere.

The best "where" is wherever you can have actual conversations, not just broadcast content.

### Part 3: HOW (1-2 min)

What's the repeatable action?

**Cold outreach:**
- DMs on LinkedIn/Twitter
- Cold emails
- Personalized, not spam

**Warm outreach:**
- Engaging in communities first, then DMing
- Responding to people asking for help
- Referral asks to existing network

**Content (that leads somewhere):**
- Posts that address ICP problems
- Ending with a CTA (DM me, link in bio, etc.)
- Consistent, not random

The key word is REPEATABLE. You do this daily or weekly. Not "when you feel like it."

Example system:
- WHO: Marketing agencies struggling with client reporting
- WHERE: LinkedIn
- HOW: Send 5 personalized DMs per day to agency owners, offering to show them how I automated reporting for another agency

That's a system. Simple, specific, repeatable.

### The Numbers Game (30 sec)

Outreach is a numbers game. Here's roughly what to expect:

- 100 outreach messages
- 10-20 responses
- 3-5 conversations
- 1-2 clients

If you're sending 5 DMs and giving up, you never gave it a chance.

Consistency beats cleverness. The system only works if you work it.

### Close (30 sec)

Here's your homework:

1. Define your ICP in one sentence
2. Pick ONE place to reach them
3. Decide on a repeatable action (and a number - how many per day/week?)

Then do it for 30 days before you decide if it's working.

That's the fundamentals series. You now know more than most builders ever learn:
- Why you've been stuck
- The three things you need
- How to pick a project
- How to build an offer
- How to reach buyers

If you want templates to make this faster - ICP worksheets, outreach scripts, pricing frameworks - that's in Premium.

But you have enough to start. Go build something. Go sell it.

See you in the community.
