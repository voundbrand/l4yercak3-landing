## Key Positioning

**You are the guide, not the guru.**

- 20 years building software
- 5 years running a marketing agency (sales + marketing skills)
- Built L4YERCAK3 platform
- Now helping vibe coders and AI builders ship AND sell

**The problem you solve:**

Builders can build, but they can't finish. And even when they finish, they can't sell. They have a graveyard of unfinished projects and zero revenue.

**Your solution:**

A community that teaches finishing + selling, with an apprenticeship where they work on REAL client projects with you.

## StoryBrand Framework

| Element | Your Story |

| **Hero** | Vibe coder / AI builder who can build but can't finish or sell |
| **Problem** | Graveyard of unfinished projects, zero revenue |
| **Guide** | You - 20 years building + 5 years sales/marketing |
| **Plan** | Join community → level up → upgrade to premium/VIP → apply for apprenticeship |
| **Call to Action** | Join free community / Upgrade / Apply for apprenticeship |
| **Success** | Shipping real projects, getting paid real money |
| **Failure** | Another year of tutorials and unfinished side projects |
