## Script

```
If you're building with AI and you've got a graveyard of unfinished projects - welcome home.

I'm Remington. 20 years building software, 5 years selling it. Now I help builders actually ship and get paid.

This community is free. Templates, frameworks, other builders who are actually doing the work. The more you participate, the more you unlock.

Want to go deeper? There's a premium tier with the full template library and office hours with me.

And if you're serious about learning by doing - not courses, not theory, actual client work - check out the apprenticeship program. You work on real projects with me, ship real software, get paid real money.

But start here. Introduce yourself, tell us what you're building.
