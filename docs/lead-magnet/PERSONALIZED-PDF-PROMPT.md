# PDF 1: Aspiring Agency Owner

**Who gets this:** 0 clients, pre-revenue, solo. They haven't started yet.

**Cover:**
- Title: **The Recurring Revenue Blueprint: Your Launch Plan**
- Subtitle: From Zero to Your First Three Clients — Without Guessing

**"Where You Are" page:**

You haven't landed your first client yet. Good — that means you haven't built bad habits yet either.

Most people start an agency by cobbling together random tools, undercharging, and figuring it out as they go. Six months later they have 3 clients, no systems, and they're working 50-hour weeks for €2,000/month. Then they wonder why scaling feels impossible.

You're going to skip that. This blueprint gives you the system before you need it — so when client #1 signs, you deliver like someone who's done this 50 times.

**Core content for this PDF (unique sections, not shared with other PDFs):**

### 1. Pick Your Vertical Before You Pick Your First Client

The biggest mistake aspiring agency owners make: trying to serve "anyone who needs marketing." You end up rebuilding everything from scratch for every client because a dentist needs completely different things than a restaurant.

Pick ONE vertical. Here's how to choose:

**The Vertical Selection Framework:**

| Criteria | Why It Matters | How to Evaluate |
|---|---|---|
| You understand the business | You can speak their language | Have you worked in or with this industry? |
| They have money | They can actually pay you | Average revenue of businesses in this vertical? |
| They need leads | Your service solves a real problem | Do they rely on new customers to survive? |
| They're local | Easier to sell face-to-face first | Can you drive to 20+ of these businesses? |
| Low tech sophistication | Less competition from in-house teams | Are they still using paper calendars? |

**Best verticals for your first 3 clients:**
- Home services (plumber, HVAC, electrician) — always need leads, always local, rarely have good marketing
- Dental/medical practices — high customer value, need patients, usually have budget
- Salons & beauty — volume business, need bookings, terrible at follow-up
- Restaurants — need reservations, need reviews, spend on marketing already

**Pick one. Not three. One.** You'll expand later. Right now, going deep in one vertical means you build one template and sell it repeatedly.

### 2. What to Build Before You Have Clients

Don't wait until you sign a client to figure out what you're delivering. Build your first deployment kit now:

**Your Starter Kit (build this before your first sales call):**

1. **One landing page template** for your chosen vertical
   - Hero section with clear headline
   - Services overview
   - Social proof section (even with placeholder testimonials)
   - Contact form / booking widget
   - Mobile-optimized

2. **One email sequence** (3 emails)
   - Email 1: Instant confirmation ("We got your inquiry, here's what happens next")
   - Email 2: Follow-up after 24 hours ("Still looking for [service]?")
   - Email 3: Follow-up after 72 hours ("Last chance — book this week and get [offer]")

3. **One CRM pipeline** with these stages:
   - New Lead → Contacted → Qualified → Proposal Sent → Won/Lost

4. **One proposal template** with your pricing (see next section)

When you can demo this kit on a sales call — showing a real, working funnel with CRM and email — you close at 2-3x the rate of someone showing a slide deck.

### 3. How to Price When You Have Zero Track Record

You can't charge €999/month with no case studies. But you also can't work for free. Here's the framework:

**The First 3 Clients Pricing Strategy:**

| Client # | What You Charge | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Client 1 | €0 (free pilot) OR €200-300 one-time | You need the case study. This is an investment, not a loss. |
| Client 2 | €500-800 one-time OR €200/month | You have one case study now. Price goes up. |
| Client 3 | €800-1,500 one-time OR €300-500/month | Two case studies. Real proof. Real pricing. |

**Critical rule:** Even client #1 (the free one) gets the FULL deployment. Don't half-ass it. This is your portfolio piece. Document everything: screenshots, lead counts, before/after.

**After 3 clients:** You stop discounting. You have proof. You have a system. You charge what it's worth. See the ROI Pitch Script below.

### 4. The ROI Pitch Script — Close Your First Client This Week

SMB owners don't care about your tech stack. They care about money. Use their own numbers to make the decision obvious.

**The Script:**

**You:** "Quick question — how many calls or inquiries do you get per week that you can't answer because you're busy with a job?"

**Client:** "I don't know... maybe 10-15?"

**You:** "And what's an average job worth to you?"

**Client:** "Around €300-500."

**You:** "So if even half of those missed calls would have converted — that's 5-7 jobs per week you're not getting. At €400 average, that's roughly €2,000-2,800 per week in lost revenue. Around €8,000-11,000 per month."

*[Pause. Let them do the math.]*

**You:** "What I do is set up a system that captures every single one of those inquiries — even at 11pm on a Saturday. It responds instantly, books the appointment, and sends them a confirmation. You wake up Monday morning with new bookings in your calendar."

**Client:** "What does something like that cost?"

**You:** "For my first three clients, I'm doing a pilot at [your price]. And if it doesn't pay for itself in the first month, you can cancel anytime."

**Why this works:**
- You never mentioned AI, automation, or technology
- You used THEIR numbers, not yours
- The cost feels tiny compared to the loss they calculated
- "Cancel anytime" removes commitment fear
- "Pilot" frames it as exclusive, not cheap

**Adapt the opening question per vertical:**
- **Salon:** "How many people DM you asking if you have openings but you respond 3 hours later?"
- **Restaurant:** "How many reservation requests come in after closing that you never see?"
- **Dentist:** "How many new patients call but get voicemail and never call back?"

### 5. Your First Week Action Plan

| Day | Action | Outcome |
|---|---|---|
| Day 1 | Pick your vertical. Research 20 local businesses in that space. | Target list ready. |
| Day 2 | Build your starter kit: landing page template, email sequence, CRM pipeline. | Demo-ready system. |
| Day 3 | Write your proposal template. Set your pricing (free pilot or discounted). | Ready to sell. |
| Day 4 | Walk into 5 businesses OR send 10 cold emails/DMs using the ROI angle. | First conversations started. |
| Day 5 | Follow up. Book a demo call. Show the working system. | Pipeline active. |
| Day 6-7 | Refine based on feedback. Adjust the template if needed. | System improving. |

**The goal isn't perfection. It's your first paying client within 2 weeks.**

# PDF 2: Early-Stage Agency (Starter)

**Who gets this:** 1-3 clients, under €5k/month, 2-3 people. They've started but haven't systematized.

**Cover:**
- Title: **The Recurring Revenue Blueprint: From Hustle to System**
- Subtitle: You Have Clients — Now Stop Rebuilding Everything From Scratch

**"Where You Are" page:**

You've landed your first clients. Revenue is coming in. You're no longer just "thinking about" starting an agency — you're running one.

But here's what's probably also true: every new client feels like starting from scratch. You're custom-quoting every project. You're manually setting up each client's funnel, CRM, and email. The work isn't hard — it's repetitive. And it's eating your time.

Right now you can handle 3 clients by brute force. But client #4? Client #5? You're going to hit a wall — and the wall isn't skill or demand. It's that you have no system.

This blueprint gives you the system. So client #4 takes 2 hours to onboard instead of 2 weeks.

**Core content for this PDF:**

### 1. The Bottleneck Audit — Find Where You're Bleeding Time

Go through this checklist honestly. Every "Yes" is a system you need to build.

| Task | You Do This Manually? | What Should Happen Instead |
|---|---|---|
| Quoting different prices per client | [ ] Yes | Standardized packages — client picks a tier |
| Building landing pages from scratch per client | [ ] Yes | Templated pages by vertical — swap logo/copy/colors |
| Setting up CRM for each client | [ ] Yes | Pre-built pipeline, clone per client |
| Writing follow-up emails per client | [ ] Yes | Template sequences, swap business name and offer |
| Manually connecting tools (CRM, email, payments) | [ ] Yes | One platform where everything is already connected |
| Sending proposals as custom documents | [ ] Yes | Proposal template with package options |
| Onboarding clients over multiple calls/emails | [ ] Yes | Single intake form + one onboarding session |
| Chasing payments/invoices | [ ] Yes | Automated billing and payment collection |

**If you checked 4+:** You're doing the work of a system. Every "Yes" above is 1-3 hours per client that should be close to zero. At 5 clients, that's 20-60 hours per month you shouldn't be spending.

### 2. Stop Custom-Quoting — The Client Packaging Framework

Custom quotes are killing you. Every project is a negotiation. Every client gets something different. You can't scale what isn't standardized.

**Create 3 packages. Clients pick one.**

| | Starter | Growth | Premium |
|---|---|---|---|
| **What's included** | Landing page + contact form + basic CRM | Full funnel + email sequence + CRM + booking | Everything in Growth + AI lead response + monthly optimization + white-label portal |
| **Delivery time** | 1-2 days | 3-5 days | 5-7 days |
| **Your time** | 2-3 hours | 4-6 hours | 2-3 hours/month (after setup) |
| **Pricing** | €500-1,000 one-time | €1,500-3,000 one-time OR €299-499/mo | €500-999/mo retainer |
| **Revenue type** | One-time | One-time or recurring | Recurring |

**Why this works:**
- You stop negotiating and start selling
- Delivery becomes repeatable — same setup, different client
- The Premium tier creates recurring revenue without more work (AI and automation handle it)
- Clients feel like they're choosing, not being sold to

**Name them for your vertical.** If you serve dentists: "Online Presence" / "Patient Acquisition" / "Full Practice Growth." The names speak their language.

### 3. Funnel Templates — Pick Your Vertical, Deploy in Hours

Stop building from scratch. Here are 6 complete funnel structures. Pick the one closest to your clients and customize the copy.

Each template = landing page + thank-you page + email sequence + CRM pipeline.

**1. Home Services** — Emergency + standard service split. "Get a quote in 60 seconds." Automated confirmation with ETA.

**2. Salon & Beauty** — Services menu with booking. "Book your next appointment in 30 seconds." Re-booking sequence 3 weeks after appointment.

**3. Restaurant** — Menu highlights, reservation form. "Reserve your table — instant confirmation." Post-visit review request.

**4. Dental/Medical** — Services + new patient intake. "Book online in 2 minutes." Reminder sequence at 1 week, 1 day, 1 hour.

**5. Real Estate** — Listings + inquiry form. "Get matched with properties instantly." Automated property alerts.

**6. Coaching/Consulting** — Authority content + application form. "Apply for a free strategy session." Qualification filter before booking.

**Your action:** Pick the one template closest to your current clients. Customize it. Use it for every new client in that vertical. Build your second template only after you've deployed the first one 3+ times.

### 4. The Math: What Changes at 5, 10, and 15 Clients

Right now, adding a client feels heavy. Here's what it looks like with and without a system:

| Metric | You Now (3 clients, no system) | You at 10 clients (with system) |
|---|---|---|
| Monthly revenue | €1,500-3,000 | €4,000-10,000 |
| Hours/week | 30-40 | 15-25 |
| Time to onboard new client | 1-2 weeks | 2 hours |
| Tool costs | €200-400/mo (4-5 tools) | €100-300/mo (one platform) |
| Can you take a vacation? | No | Yes |

**The system doesn't change your revenue per client. It changes how many clients you can handle — and how much of your life they consume.**

### 5. Your Next 30 Days

| Week | Focus | Outcome |
|---|---|---|
| Week 1 | Complete the Bottleneck Audit. Create your 3-tier package pricing. | You know what to fix. You know what to charge. |
| Week 2 | Build or customize your first funnel template for your primary vertical. | Deployable template ready. |
| Week 3 | Onboard your next client using the template and the package pricing. Time yourself. | First systematized delivery. Benchmark time. |
| Week 4 | Refine the template based on what worked. Start prospecting for clients #4-5. | System improving. Pipeline growing. |

# PDF 3: Growing Agency

**Who gets this:** 4-10 clients, €5k-10k/month, 4-7 people. They're making money but they're the bottleneck.

**Cover:**
- Title: **The Recurring Revenue Blueprint: Breaking Through the Ceiling**
- Subtitle: You're at €5-10k/month. Here's Why You're Stuck — And How to Fix It.

**"Where You Are" page:**

You're making money. Real money. €5k-10k/month. 4-10 clients. Maybe a small team.

And you're exhausted.

Every new client adds hours to your week. You're personally involved in everything — onboarding, delivery, client communication, troubleshooting. Your team helps, but they do things differently each time because there's no documented process.

You've thought about hiring more people, but the math doesn't work. Your margins are already thin — you're paying for 5-6 tools that don't talk to each other, and every integration is held together with duct tape.

This is where 80% of agencies get stuck forever. The ceiling between 10 and 20 clients isn't a revenue problem. It's a systems problem.

This blueprint shows you exactly where the bottleneck is and how to fix it.

**Core content for this PDF:**

### 1. The Bottleneck Diagnostic — Where Are Your Hours Going?

You're probably spending 40-55 hours per week. But only 10-15 of those hours are doing the work that actually generates revenue. The rest is operational overhead.

**Time Audit Exercise:**

Track your time for ONE week. Categorize every task:

| Category | Example Tasks | Target % of Your Time |
|---|---|---|
| Revenue-generating | Sales calls, pitching, closing | 40% |
| Delivery | Building funnels, writing copy, configuring systems | 30% |
| Operations | Onboarding, tool setup, connecting integrations | 10% |
| Admin | Invoicing, scheduling, client updates, email | 10% |
| Firefighting | Fixing broken automations, troubleshooting | 10% |

**If operations + admin + firefighting exceed 40% of your time, your systems are broken.** You're doing the work of software, not the work of an agency owner.

The fix isn't hiring. The fix is eliminating the operational overhead first — then hiring for the work that actually requires a human.

### 2. The 2-Hour Onboarding System

Most agencies at your stage take 2-4 weeks to onboard a client. That's 2-4 weeks of back-and-forth emails, collecting assets, configuring tools, and doing things you've done 30 times before.

**The system:**

**Before the call — send the client ONE intake form:**
- Business name, address, phone, email
- Logo (PNG, transparent background)
- Brand colors (or pick from 3 options)
- Services offered (with prices)
- Business hours
- Top 10 customer questions (FAQ)
- Website URL, social links
- "What does a great new customer look like?" (one paragraph)

**The onboarding session (2 hours):**

| Step | Time | What You Do |
|---|---|---|
| Select vertical template | 5 min | Pick closest template to their business |
| Apply branding | 15 min | Logo, colors, contact info |
| Customize copy | 20 min | Swap placeholder text with their services/FAQ |
| Connect domain | 10 min | Point their domain to the new funnel |
| Set up CRM | 10 min | Contact fields, tags, pipeline stages |
| Connect email | 10 min | Confirmation + 3-step follow-up sequence |
| Connect payments | 10 min | Stripe/payment link |
| Configure booking | 10 min | Hours, services, confirmations |
| Test everything | 15 min | Test form, email, booking |
| Go live | 5 min | Deploy + send client their login |

**This only works if you have templates ready.** If you're still building from scratch, that's your bottleneck. Build the template once, deploy it 20 times.

### 3. Margin Protection — Why Your Prices Need to Go Up

At 4-10 clients, most agencies are undercharging because they set prices when they had 0-2 clients and never raised them.

**The Pricing Upgrade Framework:**

| Your Current Pricing | The Problem | The Fix |
|---|---|---|
| One-time projects (€1-3k) | No recurring revenue. Must constantly find new clients. | Add a monthly retainer tier: €299-999/mo for ongoing optimization, AI lead response, reporting. |
| Low retainers (€200-300/mo) | Revenue doesn't cover the time you spend. | Raise to €400-600/mo minimum. Grandfather existing clients for 90 days. |
| Custom quotes per client | Inconsistent margins. Can't predict revenue. | Package into 3 tiers. Stop quoting custom. |
| Hourly billing | Penalizes efficiency. Faster = less money. | Move to value-based pricing. Charge for outcomes, not time. |

**The email to existing clients:**

> "Hi [Name], I wanted to let you know that starting [date], our pricing will be updated to reflect the expanded capabilities we now offer — including [AI lead response / automated reporting / expanded funnel features]. Your current rate will stay locked in until [90 days from now]. After that, the new monthly rate will be €[new price]. Happy to jump on a quick call if you have any questions."

Most clients won't leave. The ones who do were probably your lowest-value clients anyway.

### 4. The Tool Consolidation Math

You're probably paying for:
- Page builder: €30-100/mo
- CRM: €50-200/mo
- Email tool: €30-100/mo
- Booking tool: €20-50/mo
- Automation tool: €30-100/mo
- Payment processing tool: separate
- Maybe a chatbot or WhatsApp tool: €30-100/mo

**Total: €200-650/month. Plus YOUR time connecting them all.**

One platform replaces all of it. That's not a sales pitch — it's math. Every integration you maintain is a point of failure and an hour of debugging when it breaks.

### 5. What 20 Clients Looks Like (With Systems)

| Metric | You Now (8 clients, no system) | You at 20 clients (with system) |
|---|---|---|
| Monthly revenue | €4,000-8,000 | €8,000-20,000 |
| Hours/week | 45-55 (burnout) | 25-35 |
| Onboarding time | 2-3 weeks per client | 2 hours per client |
| Tool costs | €400-700/mo | €200-500/mo |
| Monthly profit | €2,000-4,000 | **€6,000-15,000** |
| Can you take on client #21? | Not without hiring | Yes |

**The difference isn't revenue per client. It's what you keep — and whether your business runs without you being the glue.**

# PDF 4: Scaling Agency

**Who gets this:** 11-25 clients, €10k-25k/month, 8-15 people. They've built something real. Now it needs to run without them.

**Cover:**
- Title: **The Recurring Revenue Blueprint: The Owner's Operating System**
- Subtitle: 11-25 Clients. €10k-25k/month. Build It to Run Without You.

**"Where You Are" page:**

You've done what most people only talk about. Double-digit clients. Five-figure monthly revenue. A team. Real overhead.

And you've probably noticed something uncomfortable: the business still needs you for almost everything important.

You're still the one who handles the big clients. You're still the one who troubleshoots when an onboarding goes sideways. You're still the final approver, the escalation point, the person who "just knows how it works."

That worked at 5 clients. At 15, it's breaking. At 25, it'll collapse.

The shift you need to make isn't about getting more clients. It's about building an operating system so your team can deliver at the same level you do — without you in the room.

**Core content for this PDF:**

### 1. The Owner Dependency Audit

Be honest about which of these still require YOU:

| Function | You Still Do This? | Who Should Own It |
|---|---|---|
| Final approval on client deliverables | [ ] Yes | Delivery lead with checklist |
| Sales calls and closing | [ ] Yes | Sales rep with your pitch script |
| Handling client escalations | [ ] Yes | Account manager with escalation protocol |
| Deciding pricing/proposals | [ ] Yes | Standardized packages — no custom quoting |
| Onboarding new clients | [ ] Yes | Onboarding specialist with 2-hour process |
| Troubleshooting broken automations | [ ] Yes | Tech lead or automated monitoring |
| Hiring and training | [ ] Yes | Documented hiring process + training playbook |
| Financial decisions | [ ] You (this stays with you) | |

**If you checked 4+ items:** You're the single point of failure. If you get sick for 2 weeks, what happens? If the answer is "things fall apart" — that's the problem this blueprint solves.

### 2. Documenting What's in Your Head

Your biggest operational risk: everything important is stored in your brain.

**The Documentation Sprint (do this in one focused week):**

For each of these, write down the process as if you're training someone who's never done it:

1. **Client onboarding process** — Step-by-step, intake form to go-live
2. **Client delivery checklist** — What "done" looks like for each package tier
3. **Quality control standards** — What to check before any deliverable goes to a client
4. **Client communication protocol** — Response times, escalation triggers, who handles what
5. **Tool setup guide** — How to configure the platform for a new client (screenshot every step)
6. **Pricing and proposal guide** — Which package for which client type, when to upsell

**Format:** Keep it simple. Google Docs or Notion. Bullet points, not essays. Screenshots > paragraphs. If you wouldn't read it, neither will your team.

**Test:** Hand the document to a team member. Have them onboard a client using ONLY the document. Where they get stuck = where the document needs work.

### 3. The Delegation Framework

You can't delegate everything at once. Prioritize by impact and difficulty:

**Delegate first (high time-waste, easy to hand off):**
- Client status updates → Account manager
- Invoice/payment follow-up → Automated or admin
- Initial lead response → AI agent or junior team member
- Template deployment → Junior dev/implementer following checklist

**Delegate second (medium complexity):**
- Client onboarding → Trained onboarding specialist
- Funnel customization → Implementer with template library
- Email sequence setup → Marketer following template

**Delegate last (requires judgment):**
- Sales calls → Sales rep after shadowing 10+ calls
- Client escalations → Account manager with defined protocols
- Strategy decisions → Delivery lead with guardrails

**Never delegate:**
- Financial decisions
- Key account relationships (your top 3-5 clients)
- Vision and strategy

### 4. Recurring Revenue Architecture

At your scale, one-time projects are the enemy of stability. Every month should start with a baseline of guaranteed revenue.

**The Recurring Revenue Model:**

| Revenue Type | % of Total (Target) | How to Get There |
|---|---|---|
| Monthly retainers | 60-70% | Premium tier: €500-999/mo per client. AI lead response + optimization + reporting. |
| Performance bonuses | 10-20% | % of leads generated or revenue attributed. Aligns incentives. |
| One-time projects | 10-20% | New client setup fees. Keep these, but they shouldn't be the majority. |
| Upsells to existing clients | 5-10% | Additional features, new campaigns, expanded services. |

**Target:** 15 clients at €600/mo average = €9,000/mo baseline before you open your laptop.

### 5. The Scaling Math at Your Level

| Metric | You Now (15 clients) | You at 25 clients (with systems) | You at 40 clients |
|---|---|---|---|
| Monthly revenue | €10,000-15,000 | €15,000-25,000 | €25,000-40,000 |
| Team size needed | 6-10 (you're one of them) | 8-12 (you're NOT one of them) | 12-18 (you're the CEO) |
| Your hours/week | 45-55 | 25-35 | 15-20 |
| Platform costs | €500-1,000/mo | €800-1,500/mo | €1,200-2,500/mo |
| Monthly profit (after payroll) | €3,000-6,000 | €6,000-12,000 | **€10,000-20,000** |

**The inflection point:** Between 20 and 30 clients, the agency either becomes a business that runs without you, or it becomes a job that pays well but consumes your life. The systems you build NOW determine which one you get.

# PDF 5: Established Agency

**Who gets this:** 25+ clients, €25k+/month, 15+ people. Running a real agency. Optimizing, not building.

**Cover:**
- Title: **The Recurring Revenue Blueprint: The Optimization Playbook**
- Subtitle: 25+ Clients. €25k+/Month. Every 1% Compounds.

**"Where You Are" page:**

You're running a real agency. 25+ clients. Consistent revenue. A team that handles delivery.

At this point, you don't need another "how to start an agency" guide. You need leverage.

Every improvement at your scale compounds. A 10-minute improvement in onboarding saves 250+ minutes per year. A €50/month increase in average retainer means €15,000+ annually. A 5% reduction in churn adds more to your bottom line than 3 new clients.

This isn't a blueprint for building. It's a playbook for optimizing what you've already built.

**Core content for this PDF:**

### 1. The Profit Lever Audit

At 25+ clients, small improvements create disproportionate results. Rate each lever from 1-10 on how optimized it currently is:

| Lever | Your Score (1-10) | Impact If Improved |
|---|---|---|
| Average retainer price | ___ | €50/mo increase × 25 clients = €15,000/year |
| Client churn rate | ___ | Reducing from 10% to 5% = keeping 2-3 more clients/year |
| Onboarding efficiency | ___ | 30 min saved × 25 clients/year = 12+ hours back |
| Tool consolidation | ___ | Eliminating 2 redundant tools = €1,200-3,000/year saved |
| Team utilization | ___ | Each person handling 1 more client = €5,000-10,000/year per person |
| Upsell rate | ___ | 20% of clients upgrading a tier = €20,000-50,000/year |
| Lead cost (client acquisition) | ___ | Referral system vs. paid ads = 50-80% cheaper acquisition |

**Focus on the lever with the lowest score and highest impact.** That's where your next €50,000/year lives.

### 2. The Retention Playbook — Keep What You've Built

At 25+ clients, retention is more valuable than acquisition. Losing 3 clients at €600/mo = losing €21,600/year. Replacing them costs time, money, and attention.

**Proactive Retention System:**

| When | What | Who Owns It |
|---|---|---|
| Monthly | Automated performance report sent to client (leads, conversions, revenue attributed) | System (automated) |
| Quarterly | Account review call — 15 min, show results, discuss next 90 days | Account manager |
| At risk signals | Usage drops, missed payments, support tickets increase | Alert → Account manager escalation |
| Annually | Strategy session — what's changed in their business, how to adapt | You or senior account manager |

**The quarterly call is non-negotiable.** Most agencies lose clients not because of bad work, but because the client forgot what they're paying for. 15 minutes every 90 days prevents that.

### 3. Pricing Optimization at Scale

You're probably leaving €3,000-10,000/month on the table.

**Common pricing mistakes at your scale:**

1. **Legacy clients paying legacy prices.** Client who signed 2 years ago at €300/mo when your current rate is €600/mo. That's €3,600/year you're giving away per client.
   - Fix: Annual price increase of 5-10%. Announce 90 days in advance. Frame as "expanded capabilities."

2. **Flat pricing regardless of client size.** A restaurant with 1 location pays the same as one with 5 locations.
   - Fix: Tiered pricing by client size/complexity. More locations = more deployment = higher price.

3. **No upsell path.** Clients stay on the same tier forever.
   - Fix: Quarterly review triggers upsell conversation. "Your lead volume has grown 40% — here's what the next tier unlocks."

4. **Competitive pricing instead of value pricing.** You charge based on what competitors charge, not what the service is worth.
   - Fix: ROI-based pricing. If you generate €10,000/month in leads for a client, €800/month is a no-brainer.

### 4. The Second Vertical Play

You've mastered one vertical. The biggest growth lever at your scale might be replicating the entire system for a second vertical.

**When to expand:**
- Your primary vertical is delivering consistently with documented processes
- Your team can onboard clients without your involvement
- You're seeing diminishing returns from prospecting in your vertical
- You've identified a vertical with similar needs but different buyers

**How to expand (without breaking what works):**
1. Clone your existing template system
2. Customize the copy, design, and funnel structure for the new vertical
3. Hire or assign ONE person to own the new vertical
4. Set a target: 5 clients in the new vertical within 90 days
5. Only scale it if the unit economics match your primary vertical

**Do NOT:** Try to serve both verticals with the same team, templates, or sales process. They're separate businesses that share infrastructure.

### 5. Your Agency's Dashboard — The Numbers That Matter

At your scale, you should be reviewing these weekly:

| Metric | What to Track | Healthy Range |
|---|---|---|
| MRR (Monthly Recurring Revenue) | Total contracted recurring revenue | Growing 5-10%/quarter |
| Client churn | % of clients lost per month | Under 5% monthly |
| Average revenue per client | Total revenue / total clients | Growing over time |
| Client acquisition cost | Marketing + sales cost per new client | Under 2 months of their retainer |
| Team utilization | Clients per delivery team member | 5-8 clients per person |
| Net profit margin | Revenue - all costs / revenue | 30-50% |
| Owner hours/week | Time YOU spend in the business | Under 20 hours |

**If owner hours/week exceeds 30:** You're not running an agency. You're working in one. Go back to the Delegation Framework.
