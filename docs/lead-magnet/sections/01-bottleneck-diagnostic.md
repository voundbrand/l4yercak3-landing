## Find Where You're Stuck

Before you can fix the bottleneck, you need to see it clearly. Go through this list and be honest about how many of these you're doing personally.

| Task | You Do This? | What Should Happen Instead |
|---|---|---|
| Answering client WhatsApp/email inquiries | [ ] Yes | AI agent handles first response, you handle escalations only |
| Setting up new client funnels from scratch | [ ] Yes | Deploy from a template library, customize in under 2 hours |
| Manually connecting CRM, email, payments | [ ] Yes | One platform where everything is already connected |
| Building landing pages per client | [ ] Yes | Templated pages by vertical — swap logo, copy, colors, deploy |
| Sending follow-up emails manually | [ ] Yes | Automated sequences triggered by form submissions |
| Booking meetings back and forth | [ ] Yes | Self-service booking widget on every client funnel |
| Creating reports for clients | [ ] Yes | Automated dashboards clients can check themselves |
| Chasing invoices and payments | [ ] Yes | Automated checkout and payment collection |
| Onboarding new clients (multi-week process) | [ ] Yes | Standardized onboarding checklist — under 2 hours |
| Updating client on project status | [ ] Yes | Client portal with real-time status |

**Scoring:**
- **0-2 checked:** You've already systematized well. This blueprint will help you tighten the edges.
- **3-5 checked:** You're doing too much manually. Sections 2-4 will save you 10+ hours/week.
- **6-10 checked:** You ARE the bottleneck. Every section of this blueprint applies to you. Start with Section 3 (Onboarding) — it has the fastest payoff.
