## Close Clients With Their Own Numbers

SMB owners don't care about your tech stack. They don't care about AI. They don't care about automation. They care about one thing: money.

The ROI pitch uses their real numbers to make the decision obvious. You're not selling a service — you're showing them what they're already losing.

**The Script:**

**You:** "Quick question — how many calls or inquiries do you get per week that you can't answer because you're busy with a job?"

**Client:** "I don't know... maybe 10-15?"

**You:** "And what's an average job worth to you?"

**Client:** "Around €300-500."

**You:** "So if even half of those missed calls would have converted — that's 5-7 jobs per week you're not getting. At €400 average, that's roughly €2,000-2,800 per week in lost revenue. Around €8,000-11,000 per month."

*[Pause. Let them do the math.]*

**You:** "What I do is set up a system that captures every single one of those inquiries — even at 11pm on a Saturday. It responds instantly, books the appointment, and sends them a confirmation. You wake up Monday morning with new bookings in your calendar."

**Client:** "What does something like that cost?"

**You:** "€[your price]/month. And if it doesn't pay for itself in the first month, you can cancel anytime."

**Why this works:**
- You never mentioned AI, automation, or technology
- You used THEIR numbers, not yours
- The cost is tiny compared to the loss they just calculated themselves
- "Cancel anytime" removes commitment fear
- You sold an outcome (bookings in the calendar), not a tool

**Adapt per vertical:**
- **Salon:** "How many people DM you asking if you have openings but you respond 3 hours later?"
- **Restaurant:** "How many reservation requests come in after closing that you never see?"
- **Real estate:** "How many listing inquiries come in on weekends when you're showing other properties?"

The question is always the same: **"What are you losing right now by not being available 24/7?"**
