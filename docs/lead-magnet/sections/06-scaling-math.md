## What Your Agency Looks Like at 5, 10, and 20 Clients

The numbers below work regardless of your pricing model. Plug in your own rates. The point is to see how the math changes when you deploy systems instead of rebuilding every time.

**Assumptions:**
- You charge an average of €400/month per client (retainer model) OR €2,500 one-time per project
- Platform cost: a scalable platform with per-client pricing
- Your time: onboarding is 2 hours per client (using the system from Section 3), ongoing management is 1-2 hours per client per month

**Scenario A: 5 Clients (Where Most Agencies Sit)**

| Metric | Without Systems | With Systems |
|---|---|---|
| Monthly revenue | €2,000 | €2,000 |
| Your hours/week | 25-30 hrs | 8-10 hrs |
| Tool costs/month | €200-400 (5-7 tools) | €100-200 (one platform) |
| Time to onboard new client | 2-3 weeks | 2 hours |
| Can you take a week off? | No | Yes |

---

**Scenario B: 10 Clients (The Ceiling)**

| Metric | Without Systems | With Systems |
|---|---|---|
| Monthly revenue | €4,000 | €4,000 |
| Your hours/week | 45-55 hrs (burnout zone) | 12-18 hrs |
| Tool costs/month | €400-700 | €200-400 |
| Time to onboard new client | 3-4 weeks (you're overloaded) | 2 hours |
| Can you take on client #11? | Not without hiring | Yes, easily |

---

**Scenario C: 20 Clients (The Goal)**

| Metric | Without Systems | With Systems |
|---|---|---|
| Monthly revenue | €8,000 | €8,000 |
| Your hours/week | Impossible without 2-3 staff | 20-30 hrs |
| Tool costs/month | €800-1,200 + staff salaries | €400-800 |
| Time to onboard new client | Not taking new clients | 2 hours |
| Monthly profit (after costs) | €2,000-3,000 (if you hire) | **€6,000-7,000** |

**The difference isn't revenue. It's what you keep.**

At 20 clients, the agency without systems needs staff, more tools, and more hours. The agency with systems needs the same 2-hour onboarding process it used for client #1.
