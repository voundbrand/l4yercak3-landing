## Stop Quoting Custom. Start Selling Packages.

Custom quotes are killing your margins and your time. Every proposal is a negotiation. Every client gets something slightly different. You can't systematize what isn't standardized.

The fix: package your services into 2-3 clear tiers. Clients pick one. You deliver the same thing every time, with minor customization.

**Example: Marketing Agency Tiers**

| | Bronze | Silver | Gold |
|---|---|---|---|
| **What's included** | Landing page + contact form + basic CRM setup | Full funnel (landing + thank you + email sequence) + CRM + booking | Everything in Silver + AI agent for lead response + monthly optimization + white-label portal |
| **Delivery time** | 1-2 days | 3-5 days | 5-7 days |
| **Client gets** | A live page collecting leads | A complete lead generation system | A fully managed, AI-powered client acquisition system |
| **Suggested pricing** | €500-1,000 one-time | €1,500-3,000 one-time OR €299-499/mo | €500-999/mo retainer |
| **Your time per client** | 2-3 hours | 4-6 hours | 2-3 hours/month (after initial setup) |
| **Recurring revenue** | No (unless they need hosting/updates) | Optional monthly add-on | Yes — monthly retainer |

**Key principle:** Your Bronze tier should be deployable in under 2 hours. If it takes longer, your system isn't ready. Gold is where the margin lives — because the AI and automation do the ongoing work, not you.

**Adapt this to your niche.** If you serve dentists, the tiers might be: "Online Presence" / "Patient Acquisition System" / "Full Practice Growth Platform." The structure is the same — the naming speaks their language.
