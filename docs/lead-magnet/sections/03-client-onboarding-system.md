## From Signed Contract to Live in 2 Hours

Most agencies take 2-4 weeks to onboard a new client. That's 2-4 weeks of zero revenue from that client, plus hours of back-and-forth emails collecting assets and information.

Here's the system to onboard any SMB client in under 2 hours.

**Before the call (send this form to the client):**

Collect everything upfront with a single intake form:
- Business name, address, phone, email
- Logo (PNG, transparent background)
- Brand colors (or let them pick from 3 options)
- Services offered (list with prices)
- Business hours
- 10 most common customer questions (FAQ)
- Existing website URL (if any)
- Social media links
- "What does a great new customer look like for you?" (one paragraph)

**The 2-hour onboarding session:**

| Step | Time | What You Do |
|---|---|---|
| 1. Select vertical template | 5 min | Pick the closest funnel template to their business type |
| 2. Apply branding | 15 min | Logo, colors, business name, contact info |
| 3. Customize copy | 20 min | Swap placeholder text with their services, FAQ, and value prop |
| 4. Connect domain | 10 min | Point their domain or subdomain to the new funnel |
| 5. Set up CRM | 10 min | Configure contact fields, tags, pipeline stages |
| 6. Connect email | 10 min | Set up confirmation email + 3-step follow-up sequence |
| 7. Connect payments (if applicable) | 10 min | Stripe/payment link for their services |
| 8. Configure booking (if applicable) | 10 min | Available hours, service types, confirmation messages |
| 9. Test everything | 15 min | Submit test form, receive test email, book test appointment |
| 10. Go live + notify client | 5 min | Deploy, send client their portal login, confirm everything works |

**Total: ~110 minutes.**

The key: steps 1-4 only work this fast if you have templates ready. Section 5 of this blueprint gives you 6 vertical templates to start with.
