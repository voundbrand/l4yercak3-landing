## "Where You Are"

You haven't landed your first client yet. Good — that means you haven't built bad habits yet either.

Most people start an agency by cobbling together random tools, undercharging, and figuring it out as they go. Six months later they have 3 clients, no systems, and they're working 50-hour weeks for €2,000/month. Then they wonder why scaling feels impossible.

You're going to skip that. This blueprint gives you the system before you need it — so when client #1 signs, you deliver like someone who's done this 50 times.

## Section 1: Pick Your Vertical Before You Pick Your First Client

The biggest mistake aspiring agency owners make: trying to serve "anyone who needs marketing." You end up rebuilding everything from scratch for every client because a dentist needs completely different things than a restaurant.

Pick ONE vertical. Here's how to choose:

**The Vertical Selection Framework:**

| Criteria | Why It Matters | How to Evaluate |
|---|---|---|
| You understand the business | You can speak their language | Have you worked in or with this industry? |
| They have money | They can actually pay you | Average revenue of businesses in this vertical? |
| They need leads | Your service solves a real problem | Do they rely on new customers to survive? |
| They're local | Easier to sell face-to-face first | Can you drive to 20+ of these businesses? |
| Low tech sophistication | Less competition from in-house teams | Are they still using paper calendars? |

**Best verticals for your first 3 clients:**
- Home services (plumber, HVAC, electrician) — always need leads, always local, rarely have good marketing
- Dental/medical practices — high customer value, need patients, usually have budget
- Salons & beauty — volume business, need bookings, terrible at follow-up
- Restaurants — need reservations, need reviews, spend on marketing already

**Pick one. Not three. One.** You'll expand later. Right now, going deep in one vertical means you build one template and sell it repeatedly.

## Section 2: What to Build Before You Have Clients

Don't wait until you sign a client to figure out what you're delivering. Build your first deployment kit now:

**Your Starter Kit (build this before your first sales call):**

1. **One landing page template** for your chosen vertical
   - Hero section with clear headline
   - Services overview
   - Social proof section (even with placeholder testimonials)
   - Contact form / booking widget
   - Mobile-optimized

2. **One email sequence** (3 emails)
   - Email 1: Instant confirmation ("We got your inquiry, here's what happens next")
   - Email 2: Follow-up after 24 hours ("Still looking for [service]?")
   - Email 3: Follow-up after 72 hours ("Last chance — book this week and get [offer]")

3. **One CRM pipeline** with these stages:
   - New Lead → Contacted → Qualified → Proposal Sent → Won/Lost

4. **One proposal template** with your pricing (see next section)

When you can demo this kit on a sales call — showing a real, working funnel with CRM and email — you close at 2-3x the rate of someone showing a slide deck.

## Section 3: How to Price When You Have Zero Track Record

You can't charge €999/month with no case studies. But you also can't work for free. Here's the framework:

**The First 3 Clients Pricing Strategy:**

| Client # | What You Charge | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Client 1 | €0 (free pilot) OR €200-300 one-time | You need the case study. This is an investment, not a loss. |
| Client 2 | €500-800 one-time OR €200/month | You have one case study now. Price goes up. |
| Client 3 | €800-1,500 one-time OR €300-500/month | Two case studies. Real proof. Real pricing. |

**Critical rule:** Even client #1 (the free one) gets the FULL deployment. Don't half-ass it. This is your portfolio piece. Document everything: screenshots, lead counts, before/after.

**After 3 clients:** You stop discounting. You have proof. You have a system. You charge what it's worth. See the ROI Pitch Script below.

## Section 4: The ROI Pitch Script — Close Your First Client This Week

SMB owners don't care about your tech stack. They care about money. Use their own numbers to make the decision obvious.

**The Script:**

**You:** "Quick question — how many calls or inquiries do you get per week that you can't answer because you're busy with a job?"

**Client:** "I don't know... maybe 10-15?"

**You:** "And what's an average job worth to you?"

**Client:** "Around €300-500."

**You:** "So if even half of those missed calls would have converted — that's 5-7 jobs per week you're not getting. At €400 average, that's roughly €2,000-2,800 per week in lost revenue. Around €8,000-11,000 per month."

*[Pause. Let them do the math.]*

**You:** "What I do is set up a system that captures every single one of those inquiries — even at 11pm on a Saturday. It responds instantly, books the appointment, and sends them a confirmation. You wake up Monday morning with new bookings in your calendar."

**Client:** "What does something like that cost?"

**You:** "For my first three clients, I'm doing a pilot at [your price]. And if it doesn't pay for itself in the first month, you can cancel anytime."

**Why this works:**
- You never mentioned AI, automation, or technology
- You used THEIR numbers, not yours
- The cost feels tiny compared to the loss they calculated
- "Cancel anytime" removes commitment fear
- "Pilot" frames it as exclusive, not cheap

**Adapt the opening question per vertical:**
- **Salon:** "How many people DM you asking if you have openings but you respond 3 hours later?"
- **Restaurant:** "How many reservation requests come in after closing that you never see?"
- **Dentist:** "How many new patients call but get voicemail and never call back?"
