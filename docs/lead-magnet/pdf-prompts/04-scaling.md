## "Where You Are"

You've done what most people only talk about. Double-digit clients. Five-figure monthly revenue. A team. Real overhead.

And you've probably noticed something uncomfortable: the business still needs you for almost everything important.

You're still the one who handles the big clients. You're still the one who troubleshoots when an onboarding goes sideways. You're still the final approver, the escalation point, the person who "just knows how it works."

That worked at 5 clients. At 15, it's breaking. At 25, it'll collapse.

The shift you need to make isn't about getting more clients. It's about building an operating system so your team can deliver at the same level you do — without you in the room.

## Section 1: The Owner Dependency Audit

Be honest about which of these still require YOU:

| Function | You Still Do This? | Who Should Own It |
|---|---|---|
| Final approval on client deliverables | [ ] Yes | Delivery lead with checklist |
| Sales calls and closing | [ ] Yes | Sales rep with your pitch script |
| Handling client escalations | [ ] Yes | Account manager with escalation protocol |
| Deciding pricing/proposals | [ ] Yes | Standardized packages — no custom quoting |
| Onboarding new clients | [ ] Yes | Onboarding specialist with 2-hour process |
| Troubleshooting broken automations | [ ] Yes | Tech lead or automated monitoring |
| Hiring and training | [ ] Yes | Documented hiring process + training playbook |
| Financial decisions | [ ] You (this stays with you) | |

**If you checked 4+ items:** You're the single point of failure. If you get sick for 2 weeks, what happens? If the answer is "things fall apart" — that's the problem this blueprint solves.

## Section 2: Documenting What's in Your Head

Your biggest operational risk: everything important is stored in your brain.

**The Documentation Sprint (do this in one focused week):**

For each of these, write down the process as if you're training someone who's never done it:

1. **Client onboarding process** — Step-by-step, intake form to go-live
2. **Client delivery checklist** — What "done" looks like for each package tier
3. **Quality control standards** — What to check before any deliverable goes to a client
4. **Client communication protocol** — Response times, escalation triggers, who handles what
5. **Tool setup guide** — How to configure the platform for a new client (screenshot every step)
6. **Pricing and proposal guide** — Which package for which client type, when to upsell

**Format:** Keep it simple. Google Docs or Notion. Bullet points, not essays. Screenshots > paragraphs. If you wouldn't read it, neither will your team.

**Test:** Hand the document to a team member. Have them onboard a client using ONLY the document. Where they get stuck = where the document needs work.

## Section 3: The Delegation Framework

You can't delegate everything at once. Prioritize by impact and difficulty:

**Delegate first (high time-waste, easy to hand off):**
- Client status updates → Account manager
- Invoice/payment follow-up → Automated or admin
- Initial lead response → AI agent or junior team member
- Template deployment → Junior dev/implementer following checklist

**Delegate second (medium complexity):**
- Client onboarding → Trained onboarding specialist
- Funnel customization → Implementer with template library
- Email sequence setup → Marketer following template

**Delegate last (requires judgment):**
- Sales calls → Sales rep after shadowing 10+ calls
- Client escalations → Account manager with defined protocols
- Strategy decisions → Delivery lead with guardrails

**Never delegate:**
- Financial decisions
- Key account relationships (your top 3-5 clients)
- Vision and strategy

## Section 4: Recurring Revenue Architecture

At your scale, one-time projects are the enemy of stability. Every month should start with a baseline of guaranteed revenue.

**The Recurring Revenue Model:**

| Revenue Type | % of Total (Target) | How to Get There |
|---|---|---|
| Monthly retainers | 60-70% | Premium tier: €500-999/mo per client. AI lead response + optimization + reporting. |
| Performance bonuses | 10-20% | % of leads generated or revenue attributed. Aligns incentives. |
| One-time projects | 10-20% | New client setup fees. Keep these, but they shouldn't be the majority. |
| Upsells to existing clients | 5-10% | Additional features, new campaigns, expanded services. |

**Target:** 15 clients at €600/mo average = €9,000/mo baseline before you open your laptop.

## Section 5: The Scaling Math at Your Level

| Metric | You Now (15 clients) | You at 25 clients (with systems) | You at 40 clients |
|---|---|---|---|
| Monthly revenue | €10,000-15,000 | €15,000-25,000 | €25,000-40,000 |
| Team size needed | 6-10 (you're one of them) | 8-12 (you're NOT one of them) | 12-18 (you're the CEO) |
| Your hours/week | 45-55 | 25-35 | 15-20 |
| Platform costs | €500-1,000/mo | €800-1,500/mo | €1,200-2,500/mo |
| Monthly profit (after payroll) | €3,000-6,000 | €6,000-12,000 | **€10,000-20,000** |

**The inflection point:** Between 20 and 30 clients, the agency either becomes a business that runs without you, or it becomes a job that pays well but consumes your life. The systems you build NOW determine which one you get.
