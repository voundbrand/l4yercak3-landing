## "Where You Are"

You've landed your first clients. Revenue is coming in. You're no longer just "thinking about" starting an agency — you're running one.

But here's what's probably also true: every new client feels like starting from scratch. You're custom-quoting every project. You're manually setting up each client's funnel, CRM, and email. The work isn't hard — it's repetitive. And it's eating your time.

Right now you can handle 3 clients by brute force. But client #4? Client #5? You're going to hit a wall — and the wall isn't skill or demand. It's that you have no system.

This blueprint gives you the system. So client #4 takes 2 hours to onboard instead of 2 weeks.

## Section 1: The Bottleneck Audit — Find Where You're Bleeding Time

Go through this checklist honestly. Every "Yes" is a system you need to build.

| Task | You Do This Manually? | What Should Happen Instead |
|---|---|---|
| Quoting different prices per client | [ ] Yes | Standardized packages — client picks a tier |
| Building landing pages from scratch per client | [ ] Yes | Templated pages by vertical — swap logo/copy/colors |
| Setting up CRM for each client | [ ] Yes | Pre-built pipeline, clone per client |
| Writing follow-up emails per client | [ ] Yes | Template sequences, swap business name and offer |
| Manually connecting tools (CRM, email, payments) | [ ] Yes | One platform where everything is already connected |
| Sending proposals as custom documents | [ ] Yes | Proposal template with package options |
| Onboarding clients over multiple calls/emails | [ ] Yes | Single intake form + one onboarding session |
| Chasing payments/invoices | [ ] Yes | Automated billing and payment collection |

**If you checked 4+:** You're doing the work of a system. Every "Yes" above is 1-3 hours per client that should be close to zero. At 5 clients, that's 20-60 hours per month you shouldn't be spending.

## Section 2: Stop Custom-Quoting — The Client Packaging Framework

Custom quotes are killing you. Every project is a negotiation. Every client gets something different. You can't scale what isn't standardized.

**Create 3 packages. Clients pick one.**

| | Starter | Growth | Premium |
|---|---|---|---|
| **What's included** | Landing page + contact form + basic CRM | Full funnel + email sequence + CRM + booking | Everything in Growth + AI lead response + monthly optimization + white-label portal |
| **Delivery time** | 1-2 days | 3-5 days | 5-7 days |
| **Your time** | 2-3 hours | 4-6 hours | 2-3 hours/month (after setup) |
| **Pricing** | €500-1,000 one-time | €1,500-3,000 one-time OR €299-499/mo | €500-999/mo retainer |
| **Revenue type** | One-time | One-time or recurring | Recurring |

**Why this works:**
- You stop negotiating and start selling
- Delivery becomes repeatable — same setup, different client
- The Premium tier creates recurring revenue without more work (AI and automation handle it)
- Clients feel like they're choosing, not being sold to

**Name them for your vertical.** If you serve dentists: "Online Presence" / "Patient Acquisition" / "Full Practice Growth." The names speak their language.

## Section 3: Funnel Templates — Pick Your Vertical, Deploy in Hours

Stop building from scratch. Here are 6 complete funnel structures. Pick the one closest to your clients and customize the copy.

Each template = landing page + thank-you page + email sequence + CRM pipeline.

**1. Home Services** — Emergency + standard service split. "Get a quote in 60 seconds." Automated confirmation with ETA.

**2. Salon & Beauty** — Services menu with booking. "Book your next appointment in 30 seconds." Re-booking sequence 3 weeks after appointment.

**3. Restaurant** — Menu highlights, reservation form. "Reserve your table — instant confirmation." Post-visit review request.

**4. Dental/Medical** — Services + new patient intake. "Book online in 2 minutes." Reminder sequence at 1 week, 1 day, 1 hour.

**5. Real Estate** — Listings + inquiry form. "Get matched with properties instantly." Automated property alerts.

**6. Coaching/Consulting** — Authority content + application form. "Apply for a free strategy session." Qualification filter before booking.

**Your action:** Pick the one template closest to your current clients. Customize it. Use it for every new client in that vertical. Build your second template only after you've deployed the first one 3+ times.

## Section 4: The Math: What Changes at 5, 10, and 15 Clients

Right now, adding a client feels heavy. Here's what it looks like with and without a system:

| Metric | You Now (3 clients, no system) | You at 10 clients (with system) |
|---|---|---|
| Monthly revenue | €1,500-3,000 | €4,000-10,000 |
| Hours/week | 30-40 | 15-25 |
| Time to onboard new client | 1-2 weeks | 2 hours |
| Tool costs | €200-400/mo (4-5 tools) | €100-300/mo (one platform) |
| Can you take a vacation? | No | Yes |

**The system doesn't change your revenue per client. It changes how many clients you can handle — and how much of your life they consume.**

## Section 5: Your Next 30 Days

| Week | Focus | Outcome |
|---|---|---|
| Week 1 | Complete the Bottleneck Audit. Create your 3-tier package pricing. | You know what to fix. You know what to charge. |
