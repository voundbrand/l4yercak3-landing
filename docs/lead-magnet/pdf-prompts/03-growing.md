## "Where You Are"

You're making money. Real money. €5k-10k/month. 4-10 clients. Maybe a small team.

And you're exhausted.

Every new client adds hours to your week. You're personally involved in everything — onboarding, delivery, client communication, troubleshooting. Your team helps, but they do things differently each time because there's no documented process.

You've thought about hiring more people, but the math doesn't work. Your margins are already thin — you're paying for 5-6 tools that don't talk to each other, and every integration is held together with duct tape.

This is where 80% of agencies get stuck forever. The ceiling between 10 and 20 clients isn't a revenue problem. It's a systems problem.

This blueprint shows you exactly where the bottleneck is and how to fix it.

## Section 1: The Bottleneck Diagnostic — Where Are Your Hours Going?

You're probably spending 40-55 hours per week. But only 10-15 of those hours are doing the work that actually generates revenue. The rest is operational overhead.

**Time Audit Exercise:**

Track your time for ONE week. Categorize every task:

| Category | Example Tasks | Target % of Your Time |
|---|---|---|
| Revenue-generating | Sales calls, pitching, closing | 40% |
| Delivery | Building funnels, writing copy, configuring systems | 30% |
| Operations | Onboarding, tool setup, connecting integrations | 10% |
| Admin | Invoicing, scheduling, client updates, email | 10% |
| Firefighting | Fixing broken automations, troubleshooting | 10% |

**If operations + admin + firefighting exceed 40% of your time, your systems are broken.** You're doing the work of software, not the work of an agency owner.

The fix isn't hiring. The fix is eliminating the operational overhead first — then hiring for the work that actually requires a human.

## Section 2: The 2-Hour Onboarding System

Most agencies at your stage take 2-4 weeks to onboard a client. That's 2-4 weeks of back-and-forth emails, collecting assets, configuring tools, and doing things you've done 30 times before.

**The system:**

**Before the call — send the client ONE intake form:**
- Business name, address, phone, email
- Logo (PNG, transparent background)
- Brand colors (or pick from 3 options)
- Services offered (with prices)
- Business hours
- Top 10 customer questions (FAQ)
- Website URL, social links
- "What does a great new customer look like?" (one paragraph)

**The onboarding session (2 hours):**

| Step | Time | What You Do |
|---|---|---|
| Select vertical template | 5 min | Pick closest template to their business |
| Apply branding | 15 min | Logo, colors, contact info |
| Customize copy | 20 min | Swap placeholder text with their services/FAQ |
| Connect domain | 10 min | Point their domain to the new funnel |
| Set up CRM | 10 min | Contact fields, tags, pipeline stages |
| Connect email | 10 min | Confirmation + 3-step follow-up sequence |
| Connect payments | 10 min | Stripe/payment link |
| Configure booking | 10 min | Hours, services, confirmations |
| Test everything | 15 min | Test form, email, booking |
| Go live | 5 min | Deploy + send client their login |

**This only works if you have templates ready.** If you're still building from scratch, that's your bottleneck. Build the template once, deploy it 20 times.

## Section 3: Margin Protection — Why Your Prices Need to Go Up

At 4-10 clients, most agencies are undercharging because they set prices when they had 0-2 clients and never raised them.

**The Pricing Upgrade Framework:**

| Your Current Pricing | The Problem | The Fix |
|---|---|---|
| One-time projects (€1-3k) | No recurring revenue. Must constantly find new clients. | Add a monthly retainer tier: €299-999/mo for ongoing optimization, AI lead response, reporting. |
| Low retainers (€200-300/mo) | Revenue doesn't cover the time you spend. | Raise to €400-600/mo minimum. Grandfather existing clients for 90 days. |
| Custom quotes per client | Inconsistent margins. Can't predict revenue. | Package into 3 tiers. Stop quoting custom. |
| Hourly billing | Penalizes efficiency. Faster = less money. | Move to value-based pricing. Charge for outcomes, not time. |

**The email to existing clients:**

> "Hi [Name], I wanted to let you know that starting [date], our pricing will be updated to reflect the expanded capabilities we now offer — including [AI lead response / automated reporting / expanded funnel features]. Your current rate will stay locked in until [90 days from now]. After that, the new monthly rate will be €[new price]. Happy to jump on a quick call if you have any questions."

Most clients won't leave. The ones who do were probably your lowest-value clients anyway.

## Section 4: The Tool Consolidation Math

You're probably paying for:
- Page builder: €30-100/mo
- CRM: €50-200/mo
- Email tool: €30-100/mo
- Booking tool: €20-50/mo
- Automation tool: €30-100/mo
- Payment processing tool: separate
- Maybe a chatbot or WhatsApp tool: €30-100/mo

**Total: €200-650/month. Plus YOUR time connecting them all.**

One platform replaces all of it. That's not a sales pitch — it's math. Every integration you maintain is a point of failure and an hour of debugging when it breaks.

## Section 5: What 20 Clients Looks Like (With Systems)

| Metric | You Now (8 clients, no system) | You at 20 clients (with system) |
|---|---|---|
| Monthly revenue | €4,000-8,000 | €8,000-20,000 |
| Hours/week | 45-55 (burnout) | 25-35 |
| Onboarding time | 2-3 weeks per client | 2 hours per client |
| Tool costs | €400-700/mo | €200-500/mo |
| Monthly profit | €2,000-4,000 | **€6,000-15,000** |
| Can you take on client #21? | Not without hiring | Yes |

**The difference isn't revenue per client. It's what you keep — and whether your business runs without you being the glue.**
