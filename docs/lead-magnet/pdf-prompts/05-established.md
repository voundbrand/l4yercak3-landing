## "Where You Are"

You're running a real agency. 25+ clients. Consistent revenue. A team that handles delivery.

At this point, you don't need another "how to start an agency" guide. You need leverage.

Every improvement at your scale compounds. A 10-minute improvement in onboarding saves 250+ minutes per year. A €50/month increase in average retainer means €15,000+ annually. A 5% reduction in churn adds more to your bottom line than 3 new clients.

This isn't a blueprint for building. It's a playbook for optimizing what you've already built.

## Section 1: The Profit Lever Audit

At 25+ clients, small improvements create disproportionate results. Rate each lever from 1-10 on how optimized it currently is:

| Lever | Your Score (1-10) | Impact If Improved |
|---|---|---|
| Average retainer price | ___ | €50/mo increase x 25 clients = €15,000/year |
| Client churn rate | ___ | Reducing from 10% to 5% = keeping 2-3 more clients/year |
| Onboarding efficiency | ___ | 30 min saved x 25 clients/year = 12+ hours back |
| Tool consolidation | ___ | Eliminating 2 redundant tools = €1,200-3,000/year saved |
| Team utilization | ___ | Each person handling 1 more client = €5,000-10,000/year per person |
| Upsell rate | ___ | 20% of clients upgrading a tier = €20,000-50,000/year |
| Lead cost (client acquisition) | ___ | Referral system vs. paid ads = 50-80% cheaper acquisition |

**Focus on the lever with the lowest score and highest impact.** That's where your next €50,000/year lives.

## Section 2: The Retention Playbook — Keep What You've Built

At 25+ clients, retention is more valuable than acquisition. Losing 3 clients at €600/mo = losing €21,600/year. Replacing them costs time, money, and attention.

**Proactive Retention System:**

| When | What | Who Owns It |
|---|---|---|
| Monthly | Automated performance report sent to client (leads, conversions, revenue attributed) | System (automated) |
| Quarterly | Account review call — 15 min, show results, discuss next 90 days | Account manager |
| At risk signals | Usage drops, missed payments, support tickets increase | Alert → Account manager escalation |
| Annually | Strategy session — what's changed in their business, how to adapt | You or senior account manager |

**The quarterly call is non-negotiable.** Most agencies lose clients not because of bad work, but because the client forgot what they're paying for. 15 minutes every 90 days prevents that.

## Section 3: Pricing Optimization at Scale

You're probably leaving €3,000-10,000/month on the table.

**Common pricing mistakes at your scale:**

1. **Legacy clients paying legacy prices.** Client who signed 2 years ago at €300/mo when your current rate is €600/mo. That's €3,600/year you're giving away per client.
   - Fix: Annual price increase of 5-10%. Announce 90 days in advance. Frame as "expanded capabilities."

2. **Flat pricing regardless of client size.** A restaurant with 1 location pays the same as one with 5 locations.
   - Fix: Tiered pricing by client size/complexity. More locations = more deployment = higher price.

3. **No upsell path.** Clients stay on the same tier forever.
   - Fix: Quarterly review triggers upsell conversation. "Your lead volume has grown 40% — here's what the next tier unlocks."

4. **Competitive pricing instead of value pricing.** You charge based on what competitors charge, not what the service is worth.
   - Fix: ROI-based pricing. If you generate €10,000/month in leads for a client, €800/month is a no-brainer.

## Section 4: The Second Vertical Play

You've mastered one vertical. The biggest growth lever at your scale might be replicating the entire system for a second vertical.

**When to expand:**
- Your primary vertical is delivering consistently with documented processes
- Your team can onboard clients without your involvement
- You're seeing diminishing returns from prospecting in your vertical
- You've identified a vertical with similar needs but different buyers

**How to expand (without breaking what works):**
1. Clone your existing template system
2. Customize the copy, design, and funnel structure for the new vertical
3. Hire or assign ONE person to own the new vertical
4. Set a target: 5 clients in the new vertical within 90 days
5. Only scale it if the unit economics match your primary vertical

**Do NOT:** Try to serve both verticals with the same team, templates, or sales process. They're separate businesses that share infrastructure.

## Section 5: Your Agency's Dashboard — The Numbers That Matter

At your scale, you should be reviewing these weekly:

| Metric | What to Track | Healthy Range |
|---|---|---|
| MRR (Monthly Recurring Revenue) | Total contracted recurring revenue | Growing 5-10%/quarter |
| Client churn | % of clients lost per month | Under 5% monthly |
| Average revenue per client | Total revenue / total clients | Growing over time |
| Client acquisition cost | Marketing + sales cost per new client | Under 2 months of their retainer |
| Team utilization | Clients per delivery team member | 5-8 clients per person |
| Net profit margin | Revenue - all costs / revenue | 30-50% |
| Owner hours/week | Time YOU spend in the business | Under 20 hours |

**If owner hours/week exceeds 30:** You're not running an agency. You're working in one. Go back to the Delegation Framework.
