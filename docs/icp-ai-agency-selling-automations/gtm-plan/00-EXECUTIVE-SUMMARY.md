# GTM Strategy — Executive Summary

## l4yercak3: Go-To-Market Plan for AI Agency Owners

**Date:** February 2026
**Stage:** Pre-PMF / Validation
**Primary Market:** DACH (Germany, Austria, Switzerland)
**Secondary Market:** English-speaking AI agency operators (US/UK/AU)

---

## The One-Line Pitch

**"Your clients get an AI employee. You get recurring revenue."**

l4yercak3 is a white-label AI agent platform that lets agency owners configure, brand, and resell AI agents to their SMB clients — with WhatsApp, Instagram DM, and web chat built in. GDPR by design. No code required.

---

## Why Now

Three forces converging:

1. **GoHighLevel fatigue in Europe** — SMS-centric, no native WhatsApp, no EU hosting, no German UI. Monthly Reddit threads asking "GHL alternative for Europe."
2. **The frontend gap** — Agencies can build AI backends (n8n, CrewAI, make.com) but cannot deliver professional client-facing experiences. No branded dashboard, no conversation logs, no analytics portal.
3. **WhatsApp is THE channel in DACH** — 93% penetration. 40-60% response rate vs 10-15% SMS. "GHL doesn't have WhatsApp. In Germany that's a dealbreaker."

## Hormozi 4-Quadrant Lead Generation Framework

Alex Hormozi's framework maps all lead generation into four quadrants based on two axes:
- **Volume:** One-to-One vs One-to-Many
- **Temperature:** Warm (knows you) vs Cold (doesn't know you)

### The Grid

```
                    WARM                          COLD
                    (knows you)                   (doesn't know you)

## Channel Priority (Pre-PMF)

| Priority | Channel | Quadrant | Why |
|----------|---------|----------|-----|
| 1 | **Personal outreach** | 1:1 Warm | Fastest feedback. Highest conversion. Costs nothing. |
| 2 | **Cold DMs to ICP** | 1:1 Cold | Agency owners posting GHL frustrations, WhatsApp needs, scaling problems. |
| 3 | **SEO / Comparison content** | 1:Many Warm | "GHL alternative Europe" is uncontested. Compounds over time. |
| 4 | **Reddit organic** | 1:Many Warm | ICP is actively asking questions. r/AI_Agents, r/n8n, r/agency. |
| 5 | **YouTube** | 1:Many Warm | Walkthroughs + honest founder content. EN + DE tracks. |
| 6 | **LLM discoverability** | 1:Many Warm | When people ask ChatGPT "best white-label AI platform," you want to show up. |
| 7 | **Paid ads** | 1:Many Cold | **NOT YET.** No PMF = burning money. Revisit after 25+ paying agencies. |

## Pre-PMF Mindset

Hormozi's key insight: **before product-market fit, the goal is learning, not scaling.**

- 1:1 channels (warm + cold) give you direct feedback loops
- 1:many warm (content) compounds — start now, but don't expect immediate results
- 1:many cold (paid ads) is a scaling lever — pulling it before PMF wastes money

**The sequence:**
1. Talk to 50 agency owners (1:1 warm + cold)
2. Get 5-10 beta agencies using the product
3. Publish content consistently (SEO + Reddit + YouTube)
4. Once 25+ agencies are paying and retention is stable → turn on paid
5. Once paid ads are profitable → scale
