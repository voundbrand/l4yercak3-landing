# Reddit Organic Strategy

## Why Reddit

Your ICP lives on Reddit. They're asking real questions, sharing real frustrations, and looking for real tools. Reddit is:

1. **High-intent** — people asking "what tool should I use for X" are ready to try something
2. **Trust-based** — genuine, helpful answers build reputation. Shilling gets destroyed.
3. **Indexed by LLMs** — Reddit comments appear in ChatGPT, Perplexity, and Google AI Overviews
4. **Free** — costs time, not money
5. **Compounding** — old comments continue getting upvotes and views for months/years

## The 3-Phase Approach

### Phase 1: Listen and Learn (Week 1-2)

**Do:**
- Subscribe to all target subreddits
- Read 20-30 posts per day
- Save posts where ICP is expressing pain points
- Note the exact language they use
- Identify the top 10 most common questions/frustrations

**Don't:**
- Post anything promotional
- Mention l4yercak3
- DM anyone

**What you're looking for:**
- "Looking for a GoHighLevel alternative"
- "How do you handle WhatsApp for clients?"
- "White-label AI agent platform recommendations?"
- "How are you scaling your AI agency?"
- "I built an AI agent but can't get clients"
- "GHL is getting too expensive/complex"
- "GDPR-compliant marketing tool?"

**Output:** A list of 30+ saved threads with pain points, organized by theme.

### Phase 2: Contribute Value (Week 2-4)

**Do:**
- Start commenting on relevant threads with genuine, detailed answers
- Share your expertise on agency operations, AI agents, WhatsApp, European marketing
- Be the most helpful person in the thread
- Use your personal account (founders are more credible than brands)
- Respond to questions within hours of posting (Reddit rewards early, detailed answers)

**Don't:**
- Mention l4yercak3 yet
- Link to your website
- Use marketing language
- Copy-paste the same answer across threads

**Example comment patterns:**

*Thread: "Looking for GoHighLevel alternative for European agency"*
> I run an agency in the DACH market and this was my exact problem. The three main issues with GHL for Europe:
> 1. No native WhatsApp — and in Germany, 93% of people use WhatsApp. SMS doesn't work.
> 2. No EU hosting — clients ask about DSGVO compliance and you can't answer confidently
> 3. USD pricing with no SEPA — just friction for European clients
>
> What I ended up doing was [share your actual experience building l4yercak3, framed as your journey, not a pitch]

*Thread: "How do you deliver AI agents to clients professionally?"*
> The biggest gap I've seen in the AI agency space is the frontend. You can build amazing AI workflows in n8n or make.com, but when it comes to giving the client a dashboard where they can see conversations, analytics, and manage their AI agent — most agencies are cobbling together Retool dashboards or Google Sheets.
>
> What I've found works: a white-label portal where each client gets their own branded login. They see their conversations, their bookings, their analytics. The agency manages everything from an admin dashboard. Clients feel like they have a real product, not a duct-tape solution.

*Thread: "I can't scale past 20 clients"*
> The scaling ceiling is real. Every new client is 5-10 hours/week of setup and management when you're doing it manually.
>
> What breaks it: templates. Build your AI agent configuration once for a vertical (say, home services), then deploy it to every new plumber/HVAC/electrician client with just config changes (business name, hours, services, FAQ). Now adding a client takes 30 minutes, not 10 hours.

**Volume:** 5+ quality comments per week. Quality > quantity.

### Phase 3: Natural Product Mentions (Week 4+)

**When to mention l4yercak3:**
- Someone directly asks "what tool do you use?" or "any recommendations?"
- You've already established yourself as a helpful contributor
- You can share genuinely, as a founder, not as a marketer
- The product is directly relevant to the question

**How to mention it:**

*Thread: "What tools do you use for white-label AI agents?"*
> Full disclosure, I'm building something in this space — l4yercak3. It's a white-label AI agent platform specifically for agencies. You configure agents per client, brand the portal under your agency name, and charge recurring revenue. WhatsApp-native, EU-hosted, GDPR by design.
>
> Still early, but happy to give you early access if you want to try it. Also happy to just answer questions about the space if you're evaluating options.

**Rules:**
- Always disclose you're the founder/builder
- Never pretend to be a random user recommending your product
- Share alongside other options when asked for recommendations (honesty builds trust)
- If your product doesn't fit the question, don't force it

## Comment Templates

These are starting points, not copy-paste scripts. Adapt to each thread.

**For GHL frustration threads:**
> I hear you on this. [Specific problem they mentioned] is exactly why [your perspective/experience]. For European agencies specifically, the three dealbreakers with GHL are [WhatsApp, GDPR, language]. [Your insight on what the ideal solution looks like].

**For "how do I scale" threads:**
> The pattern I've seen work for agencies at your stage: [relevant advice]. The key inflection point is when you stop treating each client as a custom project and start treating them as a configuration of a template. [Specific example].

**For "what tools do you use" threads:**
> [Honest answer about your stack and experience]. For the client-facing piece specifically, I'm building l4yercak3 — it's a white-label AI agent platform. [One sentence on what makes it different]. Happy to share more details or answer questions about the space generally.

**For technical "how to build X" threads:**
> [Genuine technical advice]. If you want to see how we approached this: [specific architectural decision or approach]. [Helpful context regardless of whether they use your product].

## What NOT to Do on Reddit

1. **Never create multiple accounts to upvote yourself.** Reddit detects this and bans accounts.
2. **Never post "check out my product" threads.** They get downvoted and removed.
3. **Never use marketing language.** Words like "revolutionary," "game-changing," or "disruptive" trigger instant distrust.
4. **Never ignore criticism.** If someone says "this looks like every other chatbot platform," engage honestly. "Fair point. Here's what's actually different: [specific differentiator]."
5. **Never spam the same comment.** Tailor every response to the specific thread.
6. **Never DM people unsolicited with your pitch.** Only DM if they explicitly ask or show strong interest.
7. **Never argue with trolls.** One snarky comment from a troll is not worth your energy. Move on.
