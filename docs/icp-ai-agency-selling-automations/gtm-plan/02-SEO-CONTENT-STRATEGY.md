# SEO Content Strategy

## Overview

SEO is a 1:Many Warm channel. It compounds over time. The goal is to own the search intent for agency owners looking for alternatives to GoHighLevel, WhatsApp automation solutions, and white-label AI platforms — especially in DACH.

Key advantage: These keywords are underserved. GHL dominates US search but has almost no presence for European/DACH-specific queries.

| Article | Target Keyword |
|---------|---------------|

## Content Format Guidelines

**Structure every article:**
1. Hook (problem statement or question)
2. Context (why this matters, data if available)
3. Main content (comparison, how-to, analysis)
4. Where l4yercak3 fits (natural, not forced)
5. CTA (early access, free trial, waitlist)

**Writing style:**
- Direct, no fluff. Agency owners are busy.
- Use their language: "I'm the bottleneck," "trading time for money," "GHL is getting expensive"
- Include real numbers where possible (WhatsApp 93% penetration, 60-80% missed calls)
- Don't say "chatbot" — say "AI agent" or "AI employee"
- Don't use hype language ("revolutionary," "game-changing") — audience is cynical
- Be honest about limitations. Trust > marketing.

**Technical SEO:**
- H1 = exact target keyword or close variation
- Meta description includes keyword + value proposition
- Internal linking between articles
- Schema markup for comparison articles (Product schema)
- Alt text on all images
- Fast page load (already good with Next.js static generation)
