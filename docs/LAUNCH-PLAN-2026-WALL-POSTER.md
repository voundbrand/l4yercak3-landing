# ⚠️ WARNING SIGNS

**Red flags to watch for:**

| Week | If This Happens | Do This |
|:-----|:----------------|:--------|

| Week 6 | 0 Build Sprint apps | Fix outreach—more volume, different targets |
| Week 8 | High churn (>20%) | Fix product—talk to churned customers |
| Week 12 | <5 customers | Major pivot needed—revisit ICP, offer, pricing |

# 🧠 REMEMBER

## When It's Hard

> "The first 10 customers are the hardest. After that, you have proof. You have stories. You have referrals. Get to 10."

## When You Want to Add Features

> "No one is asking for more features. They're asking for the pain to stop. Ship what you have. Make it work."

## When You Want to Lower Prices

> "If they won't pay €199, they won't pay €99 either. The problem isn't price—it's perceived value. Show them the value."

## When You Feel Behind

> "You're not competing with anyone else's timeline. You're competing with yesterday's version of yourself. Are you shipping? Then you're winning."
