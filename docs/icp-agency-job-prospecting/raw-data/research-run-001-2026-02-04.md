## Key Takeaways from Run #001

2. **Upwork project posts are the highest-intent signal.** Agencies posting projects to BUILD automation are literally describing what l4yercak3 already does.
3. **GHL Hire (ghlhire.com) is a goldmine.** An entire job board of agencies hiring people to manage the tool l4yercak3 replaces.
4. **DACH hiring happens on social media, not job boards.** Instagram ads and LinkedIn posts are the primary channels for DACH agency roles.
5. **The cost arbitrage is real.** Average automation specialist salary ($91-169k) vs. l4yercak3 annual cost ($6-24k) = 75-90% savings.
6. **The Upwork freelance market validates pricing.** Agencies pay $1,000-$10,000 per automation PROJECT. l4yercak3 at $500-2,000/mo is competitive with recurring value.
