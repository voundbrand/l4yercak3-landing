## How This Works

1. Search job boards, freelance platforms, and social media for agency automation roles
2. Score each listing using the [Qualification Criteria](../l4yercak3_systems/job-post-prospecting/02-QUALIFICATION-CRITERIA.md)
3. Respond to Grade A/B leads using [Outreach Templates](../l4yercak3_systems/job-post-prospecting/03-OUTREACH-TEMPLATES.md)
4. Position l4yercak3 using [Pitch Framework](../l4yercak3_systems/job-post-prospecting/04-PITCH-POSITIONING.md)
