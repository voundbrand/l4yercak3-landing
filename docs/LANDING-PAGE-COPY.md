## 1. ONE-LINER

*Use everywhere: header, social bios, email signatures, podcast intros*

**Formula:** Problem → Solution → Result

### Version A (Punchy)
> Most AI builders have a graveyard of unfinished projects and zero revenue. We help you ship and sell through a community of builders who actually finish. Stop starting over—start getting paid.

### Version B (Conversational)
> You can build anything, but you can't seem to finish or sell it. Join a community that teaches you to ship and get paid. So you can finally turn your skills into income.

### Version C (Shortest)
> We help AI builders stop starting over and start getting paid.

**Selected:** Version C (Shortest)

## 3. PROBLEM / STAKES SECTION

### Section Header
```
Sound Familiar?
```

### Pain Point 1: The Graveyard
```
You've got a hard drive full of half-finished projects. Apps you started but never launched. Ideas that got 80% done and then... nothing.
```

### Pain Point 2: The Loop
```
Another tutorial. Another course. Another framework. You keep learning but never earning. The skill goes up, the income stays flat.
```

### Pain Point 3: The Catch-22
```
You need clients to get experience. You need experience to get clients. So you stay stuck, building things nobody pays for.
```

### Stakes (Failure)
```
A year from now, what changes?

Without a system, you'll have three more unfinished projects. You'll still be watching others ship while you're stuck in tutorial hell. You'll still be trading hours for dollars—or worse, hours for nothing.

The projects won't finish themselves. The clients won't magically appear.
```

## 4. GUIDE SECTION

### Section Header
```
I've Been There
```

### Empathy (connection first)
```
I spent years building things nobody used. I'd finish a website, create software, deliver a product—and then... nothing. It just sat there. Not because it wasn't good, but because I didn't know how to position it. I had the skills to build anything, but I didn't have the marketing and sales skills to present it correctly.
```

### Authority (credentials second)
```
Eventually, I figured it out. 20 years building software. 5 years running a marketing agency where I had to sell every single project. I learned that building is only half the game—shipping and selling is the other half.

Now I help builders like you do both.
```

## 5. THE PLAN (3 Steps)

### Section Header
```
Here's How It Works
```

### Step 1: Join the Community
```
Sign up for free. Introduce yourself. Tell us what you're building. You'll get access to templates, frameworks, and other builders who are actually doing the work.
```

### Step 2: Level Up
```
The more you participate, the more you unlock. Hit milestones, share your progress, help others. You'll earn access to better templates, project teardowns, and direct feedback.
```

### Step 3: Ship and Get Paid
```
Stop building in isolation. Get accountability to actually finish. Learn to sell what you build. When you're ready, apply for the apprenticeship and work on real client projects with me.
```

---

## 6. SUCCESS / TRANSFORMATION SECTION

### Section Header
```
Imagine This Instead
```

### Paint the Win (vivid future state)
```
Six months from now:

- You've shipped two projects that people actually use
- You've got clients paying you real money for your skills
- Other builders are asking YOU how you did it
- Your portfolio isn't fake apps—it's proof that you deliver
- You've stopped starting over and started stacking wins
```

### Contrast Statement
```
The difference between builders who make it and builders who stay stuck isn't talent. It's finishing. It's selling. It's being around others who push you to ship.
```

---

## 7. EXPLANATORY PARAGRAPH
