- YouTube comments on agency scaling videos
- Twitter threads about tech stack problems
- Skool/Facebook communities for AI agencies

**Outreach template:**

```
Hey [Name],

Saw your post about [specific pain point]. I've been there—spent 
2 years duct-taping tools before I built something better.

I'm working with a few agency owners on a 12-week program to set 
up their entire delivery platform. No more Zapier. No more tool 
chaos. One system.

Not sure if it's a fit, but happy to do a quick call and share 
what I've learned. Either way, I think you'd find it useful.

[Link to calendar]
```

**Volume:** 10 outreach messages/day = 300/month = 5-10 calls = 1-2 Build Sprint customers
