# Open Questions

## Pricing & Business Model

1. **What are the actual token base rates?** The calculator uses $0.01/token as a placeholder. What's the real number — or range?

2. **Are the kickback tiers confirmed?** The spec assumes 5 tiers from 5% to 25%. Are these real, aspirational, or TBD?

3. **Is there a minimum commitment for agencies?** Monthly minimum spend, minimum number of clients, or contractual lock-in?

4. **Is there an agency partner tier system?** (e.g., Silver/Gold/Platinum based on volume) — if so, this could replace or augment the kickback tier display.

5. **What does the free tier actually include?** How many tokens, how many clients, any feature restrictions?

## Product & Technical

6. **Which ontologies are actually available today vs. planned?** The copy lists CRM, events, checkout, invoicing, booking — are all of these live?

7. **Is white-labeling fully functional?** Custom domains, logos, color themes — all working, or partially implemented?

8. **What does the agency dashboard look like?** Can we screenshot it for the page, or is it still in development?

9. **How does the demo request flow work?** Where should "Book a Demo" go — Calendly, a custom form submitted to Convex, an email?

10. **Is there an agency onboarding flow?** Separate from end-user sign-up?

## Content & Social Proof

11. **Do we have any agency testimonials or case studies?** Even informal quotes from early users would help.

12. **Can we reference real usage numbers?** "X tokens consumed" or "Y agencies onboarded" — only if true.

13. **Should the founder appear on this page?** The main landing has a founder story/guide section. Relevant here?

## Page & Navigation

14. **URL: `/agencies` or `/for-agencies`?** Preference?

15. **Should this page be linked from the main nav, or is it a direct-send URL?** (i.e., do visitors find it from the homepage, or does the sales team send it directly?)

16. **Should this page support German translations from launch?** Or English-only initially?

17. **Do we need a separate mobile layout for the token calculator, or is responsive sufficient?**

## Design

18. **Do we have brand assets for agencies?** Any specific visuals, diagrams, or illustrations already created?

19. **Should this page have a video component?** A 60-second explainer could be powerful here.

20. **Dark mode only, or should we support the sepia reading mode from the main landing?**

## Decisions needed before building

### Must-have answers:
- Token pricing (question 1)
- Demo request flow (question 9)
- URL path (question 14)

### Nice-to-have answers:
- Kickback tiers (question 2)
- Available ontologies (question 6)
- Social proof (questions 11-12)

### Can default and change later:
- Navigation placement (question 15)
- German translations (question 16)
- Reading mode support (question 20)
