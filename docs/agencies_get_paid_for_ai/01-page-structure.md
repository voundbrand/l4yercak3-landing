# Page Structure & Section Breakdown

## Section 1: Hero

**Purpose:** Instantly communicate the revenue opportunity. Not "we have AI tools" — "you make money when your clients use AI."

**Headline options (pick one, test others):**

1. "Your clients will use AI. You should be the one selling it."
2. "Give your clients AI. Get paid every time they use it."
3. "Turn AI into recurring revenue for your agency."
4. "Stop selling hours. Start selling AI."

**Subheadline:**
"L4YERCAK3 gives you a white-label AI platform your clients actually use — and you earn on every interaction."

**CTAs:**
- Primary: "Book a Demo" (calendly or form)
- Secondary: "See How the Math Works" (scrolls to token calculator)

**Visual:**
- Abstract representation of tokens flowing from end-customer → agency → L4YERCAK3
- Or: simple dashboard mockup showing agency earnings
- Keep it clean, no stock photos

## Section 2: The Problem

**Purpose:** Name the pain so they feel understood.

Three cards, similar to existing problem section pattern:

### Card 1: "Your clients need AI. You can't build it for them."
Custom AI development costs six figures and takes months. Your clients can't afford it. You can't staff it. So they go find it themselves — or worse, they don't adopt AI at all, and fall behind.

### Card 2: "AI tools exist. But they cut you out."
When your clients sign up for ChatGPT or Jasper or whatever, you don't earn anything. You lose the relationship. You become the agency that didn't help them with the most important shift in a decade.

### Card 3: "Project fees don't scale. Token revenue does."
You bill $5K for a website. $10K for a campaign. Then it's over. What if every client you onboarded generated ongoing revenue — automatically — just by using the tools you set up for them?

## Section 3: The Three-Layer Model

**Purpose:** Show how it works architecturally. This is the "aha" moment.

Visual component — three stacked/connected layers:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  LAYER 3: YOUR CLIENT'S CUSTOMERS       │
│  They chat, book, buy, fill out forms.  │
│  Every interaction consumes tokens.      │
│  They never see L4YERCAK3.              │
├─────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  LAYER 2: YOUR AGENCY                   │
│  You configure AI agents, workflows,    │
│  knowledge bases. Set your own prices.  │
│  You own the client relationship.       │
├─────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  LAYER 1: L4YERCAK3                     │
│  We provide the infrastructure:         │
│  AI models, ontologies, automation      │
│  engine, builder, token system.         │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Key messages per layer:**

- **L4YERCAK3:** "We build and maintain the platform so you don't have to."
- **Agency:** "You configure it, brand it, price it, and sell it. Your clients see YOUR brand."
- **Client:** "They get AI tools that actually work — without knowing or caring about the technology behind them."

**Design note:** This should be a visually striking component. Consider:
- Animated layers that build up on scroll
- Connection lines showing token flow (bottom-up) and value flow (top-down)
- Each layer clickable/hoverable for more detail

## Section 4: The Revenue Model (Token Economics)

**Purpose:** Make the money real. This is where agencies lean forward.

### Static explanation:

"Here's how you make money:

1. You buy tokens from L4YERCAK3 at our base rate.
2. You set your own markup — whatever makes sense for your clients.
3. Your clients' customers interact with AI agents, submit forms, trigger automations. Each interaction consumes tokens.
4. You keep the margin on every token consumed.
5. As your clients' usage grows, you earn volume kickbacks — your effective cost drops.
6. **The more AI your clients use, the more money you make.**"

### Interactive calculator:

See `02-token-calculator.md` for full spec.

### Concrete example (static fallback):

```
Agency buys:     100,000 tokens at $0.01 each = $1,000
Agency prices:   AI access at $0.025 per token equivalent
10 clients use:  100,000 tokens total in a month

Agency revenue:  $2,500
Agency cost:     $1,000
Agency margin:   $1,500/month

+ Volume kickback at 100K tokens: effective cost drops to $0.008
Next month margin on same usage: $1,700
```

## Section 5: What Agencies Deploy

**Purpose:** Show breadth of what's possible. Not feature list — use case list.

Grid of 6-8 cards, each showing a concrete client deliverable:

1. **AI Chat Agents** — "Train an agent on your client's business. Their customers get instant answers. You earn per conversation."

2. **Smart Lead Funnels** — "Forms that qualify leads, follow up automatically, and book meetings. No manual work for your client."

3. **AI Booking & Scheduling** — "Customers book directly through an AI that knows availability, preferences, and context."

4. **Automated Invoicing & Checkout** — "AI-powered checkout flows that adapt to the customer. Upsells, payment plans, smart receipts."

5. **Event Management** — "Attendee communication, scheduling, follow-ups — all automated. Your client just runs the event."

6. **Knowledge Base Agents** — "Upload docs, SOPs, product info. The AI answers questions based on your client's actual knowledge."

7. **Email Campaigns** — "AI writes, segments, and sends. Your client gets campaigns that actually sound like their brand."

8. **Custom Workflows** — "Connect any trigger to any action. The visual builder means you can prototype in minutes."

**Design:** Card grid, each with an icon, title, one-liner, and a subtle "tokens consumed per interaction" indicator to reinforce the revenue angle.

## Section 6: How It Works (5 Steps)

**Purpose:** Remove friction. Make it feel easy.

1. **Sign up as an agency partner** — Get access to the platform, the builder, and your agency dashboard.

2. **Configure your first client** — Set up AI agents, choose ontologies (CRM, booking, checkout...), build workflows, upload knowledge.

3. **Brand it as yours** — White-label everything. Your logo, your domain, your colors. The client sees YOUR product.

4. **Deploy to your client** — Hand them a portal, an embed, a URL. They start using it immediately.

5. **Earn on every interaction** — Tokens flow. Your dashboard shows usage, revenue, and margin in real time.

**Design:** Numbered steps, vertical or horizontal timeline. Each step has an icon and 1-2 sentences. Consider subtle animation on scroll.

## Section 7: Social Proof

**Purpose:** Build credibility.

**If available:**
- Testimonials from agencies already using the platform
- Usage numbers (tokens consumed, clients onboarded)
- Logos of agency partners

**If not yet available (likely the case):**
- "Join the agencies already building with L4YERCAK3" with a waitlist/early access CTA
- Founder quote about the vision
- Reference existing trusted logos from main landing (mele Group, HaffNet, Hinrichs) if applicable

---

## Section 8: Final CTA

**Purpose:** Close.

**Headline:** "Your clients are going to use AI. The question is: will they get it from you — or someone else?"

**Subheadline:** "Set up your first client in under an hour. Start earning on every AI interaction."

**CTA:** "Book a Demo" / "Start Free"

**Design:** Full-width dark section, bold typography, single CTA. No distractions.
