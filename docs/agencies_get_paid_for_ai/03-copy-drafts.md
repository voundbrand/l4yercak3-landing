# Copy Drafts — Agency Landing Page

## Tone reminders

- Talk like you're explaining a business model to a smart founder over coffee
- No "leverage," "unlock," "empower," "supercharge," "revolutionize"
- Say what actually happens: "Your client's customer asks a question. The AI answers it. You get paid."
- Numbers over adjectives. "$1,500/month in margin" beats "incredible passive income"
- Respect that agencies know their business — they need tooling and a revenue model, not education on what AI is

## Hero Section

### Option A (Direct)
**Headline:** Give your clients AI. Get paid every time they use it.
**Sub:** L4YERCAK3 is a white-label AI platform you configure for your clients. They get AI agents, automations, and tools. You earn margin on every token consumed.

### Option B (Problem-first)
**Headline:** Your clients will use AI. The question is: will they get it from you?
**Sub:** L4YERCAK3 lets you sell AI-powered tools to your clients under your brand. You set the price. You keep the margin. They never see us.

### Option C (Revenue-first)
**Headline:** Turn every client into a recurring AI revenue stream.
**Sub:** Set up AI agents, automations, and workflows for your clients. Every time their customers interact, tokens are consumed — and you earn the spread.

### Option D (Blunt)
**Headline:** Stop selling hours. Start selling AI.
**Sub:** L4YERCAK3 gives agencies a complete AI platform to resell. Configure it once per client, earn continuously as they use it.

## Problem Section

### Card 1: You can't build AI from scratch
"Your clients are asking about AI. Maybe they want a chatbot, maybe automated follow-ups, maybe smarter forms. You know they need it. But building custom AI tools takes months, costs six figures, and requires ML engineers you don't have. So the conversation stalls."

### Card 2: Off-the-shelf AI cuts you out
"When a client signs up for ChatGPT or any other AI tool directly, you're not in the loop. You don't earn anything. You don't control the experience. You lose the relationship — and the recurring revenue that should come with it."

### Card 3: Project fees end. Token revenue doesn't.
"You build a website for $8K. A campaign for $12K. A funnel for $5K. Then it's done. What if every client you onboarded generated $500, $1,000, $2,000 per month in ongoing margin — automatically — just because their customers are using the tools you set up?"

## Three-Layer Model Copy

### Layer 1: L4YERCAK3 (The Infrastructure)
"We handle the hard parts. AI model integration. Ontology design. Automation engine. Token infrastructure. Knowledge base system. Visual builder. You don't need to build any of this — it's ready."

**What we provide:**
- Pre-built ontologies (CRM, events, checkout, invoicing, booking, and more)
- Automation workflows that trigger on real business events
- A visual builder with AI skills — no code required
- Knowledge base system for RAG-powered AI agents
- Token/credit infrastructure with built-in revenue sharing

### Layer 2: Your Agency (The Configurator)
"This is your layer. You decide what each client gets. You configure the AI agents, set up the workflows, build the knowledge bases, and set your own pricing. Your clients see your brand, not ours."

**What you control:**
- AI agent personalities, tone, and behavior per client
- Pipelines, workflows, and automation rules
- Knowledge bases — upload docs, SOPs, product info per client
- Skills and templates — what the AI can do
- Token markup and pricing — you set the margin

### Layer 3: Your Client's Customers (The Users)
"This is where the money is made. Your client's customers chat with AI agents, fill out forms, book appointments, check out, get follow-ups. Every interaction consumes tokens. They don't know about L4YERCAK3. They don't care. They just use the tools — and your agency earns."

**What end-customers do:**
- Chat with AI agents trained on the client's business
- Fill out smart forms that qualify and route automatically
- Book appointments through AI-powered scheduling
- Check out and pay through intelligent payment flows
- Receive automated follow-ups, reminders, and communications

## Revenue Model Copy

### The simple version
"You buy tokens from us at base rate. You sell AI access to your clients at your markup. When their customers interact with AI — asking questions, filling out forms, booking appointments — tokens get consumed. You keep the margin on every single token."

### The kicker
"And here's where it gets better: the more your clients use, the lower your effective cost becomes. We share volume kickbacks back to you. So as you onboard more clients and drive more usage, your margins actually grow."

### The math (narrative form)
"Say you onboard 10 clients. Each client's customers use about 10,000 tokens per month. That's 100,000 tokens total. At base rate, those cost you $1,000. You charge your clients $2,500 (a 2.5x markup — common and fair for the value they're getting). That's $1,500 in monthly margin. At 100K tokens, you qualify for a 10% volume kickback — so next month, your cost drops to $900. Same revenue. $1,600 margin. And it keeps getting better."

### The bottom line
"You make money by helping your clients use AI. The more they use it, the more you earn. Their success is literally your revenue."

## What Agencies Deploy Copy

### AI Chat Agents
"Train an AI on your client's business — their products, services, FAQs, policies. Their customers get instant, accurate answers 24/7. You earn on every conversation."

### Smart Lead Funnels
"Build forms that don't just collect data — they qualify leads, score them, and trigger automated follow-ups. Your client gets warm leads without lifting a finger."

### AI Booking & Scheduling
"An AI that knows availability, handles preferences, sends confirmations, and follows up. Your client's customers book without the back-and-forth."

### Automated Invoicing & Checkout
"Smart checkout flows that handle upsells, payment plans, and receipts. Adaptive and intelligent — not just a payment form."

### Event Management
"Automated attendee communication, scheduling, reminders, and post-event follow-ups. Your client focuses on the event. The AI handles the logistics."

### Knowledge Base Agents
"Upload documentation, SOPs, product manuals. The AI becomes an expert on your client's business and answers questions based on real information — not hallucinations."

## How It Works Copy

### Step 1: Sign up as an agency partner
"Create your agency account. Get access to the builder, the dashboard, and the full platform. Free tier available to test with."

### Step 2: Configure your first client
"Pick ontologies (CRM, booking, checkout — whatever fits). Set up AI agents. Upload knowledge. Build workflows. The visual builder makes this fast."

### Step 3: Brand it as yours
"White-label everything. Your logo, your colors, your domain. Your client sees your product, not ours. You own the relationship."

### Step 4: Deploy
"Give your client their portal, embed the tools on their site, or send them a link. They're live."

### Step 5: Earn on every interaction
"As your client's customers use the AI — chatting, booking, buying, filling out forms — tokens are consumed. Your dashboard shows usage, revenue, and margin in real time."

## FAQ Copy

**Q: Do my clients see L4YERCAK3?**
A: No. Everything is white-labeled. Your clients see your brand, your domain, your name. L4YERCAK3 is invisible.

**Q: Do I need to be technical?**
A: No. The visual builder is designed for non-developers. You configure behavior, not code. If you can use a CRM, you can use this.

**Q: How should I price AI to my clients?**
A: Most agencies charge 2-3x the base token cost. We provide pricing benchmarks and templates to help you find the right price point for your market.

**Q: What AI models are used?**
A: We integrate multiple frontier models and manage the complexity for you. You configure what the AI does and how it behaves — we handle the infrastructure.

**Q: Can I try it before committing?**
A: Yes. Free tier available. Set up a test client and see how it works before you start selling.

**Q: What happens if a client churns?**
A: Their configuration and data stay in your agency account. You can re-deploy, reassign, or archive. Nothing is lost.

**Q: How do volume kickbacks work?**
A: As your total token consumption across all clients grows, you unlock lower effective costs. The tiers are transparent — you can see them in your dashboard at all times.
