# Layer Cake vs GoHighLevel: Competitive Positioning

> We're not complementary. We're the replacement.

---

## The New Positioning

**Old (weak):**
> "Layer Cake complements GoHighLevel. GHL does marketing automation, we do app building."

**New (strong):**
> "Layer Cake is what GoHighLevel should be. AI-native. Simpler. Built for 2025. One platform to replace them all."

---

## Why This Works

1. **Clarity** — Everyone knows GHL. Saying "we replace GHL" instantly communicates what we do.

2. **Controversy** — GHL has fans AND haters. Both will engage with "GHL alternative" content.

3. **Hot audience** — GHL users already pay $297-497/month. They're pre-qualified buyers.

4. **Differentiation** — Instead of being "another platform," we're "the next evolution."

## The Attack Angles

### Angle 1: "GHL Is Stuck in 2018"
```
GoHighLevel was built for a different era.

Before AI could build pages.
Before v0 could prototype apps.
Before agencies could deliver in days instead of weeks.

Layer Cake is built for what's next.
```

### Angle 2: "The Complexity Tax"
```
GHL has a learning curve that costs you weeks.

Snapshots. Workflows. Sub-accounts. Triggers.

Layer Cake is simpler by design.
AI handles the complexity. You handle the clients.
```

### Angle 3: "The Stack Replacement"
```
I used to pay:
- GHL: €297/month
- Webflow: €49/month
- Typeform: €59/month
- HubSpot: €150/month
- Zapier: €89/month

Total: €644/month

Layer Cake: €499/month. Everything.
```

### Angle 4: "AI-Native vs AI Bolt-On"
```
GHL added AI features.
Layer Cake was BUILT on AI.

There's a difference.
```

## Content Pieces (Reddit/Twitter)

### Post 1: "Why I Switched from GoHighLevel"
```
I used GoHighLevel for 3 years running my agency.

It's a good tool. But it's showing its age.

Here's why I switched:

1. The page builder is clunky
GHL's page builder works, but it feels like 2018.
Drag and drop. Manual styling. No AI.

Layer Cake: Describe what you want, AI builds it.

2. The learning curve is brutal
GHL has a million features. That sounds good until you're 3 weeks in
still watching tutorials on how to set up a basic workflow.

Layer Cake: Simpler by design. Less to learn.

3. It doesn't do custom apps
GHL is great for funnels and automations.
But when a client says "build me an app with login and payments"?
GHL can't help you.

Layer Cake: That's the core use case.

4. It's not AI-native
GHL has AI features bolted on.
Layer Cake was built from the ground up with AI at the center.

---

Don't get me wrong — GHL is still good for certain use cases.

But if you're an agency in 2025 trying to deliver faster with AI,
there's a better option now.
```

### Post 2: "I Replaced My €600/Month Stack"
```
Here's what I was paying to run my agency:

- GoHighLevel: €297/month
- Webflow: €49/month
- Typeform: €59/month
- Calendly: €15/month
- Zapier: €89/month
- Random other tools: €100/month

Total: ~€600/month

Now I pay €499/month for Layer Cake.

One platform. Everything.

Page builder. CRM. Forms. Payments. Messaging.
AI that actually works.

And I deliver faster than I ever did with the old stack.

The "best of breed" approach made sense in 2018.
In 2025, it's just expensive complexity.
```

### Post 3: "The Honest GHL Review Nobody Asked For"
```
I used GoHighLevel for 3 years. Here's my honest take:

WHAT GHL DOES WELL:
✓ All-in-one platform (genuinely)
✓ White-label for agencies
✓ Great affiliate program
✓ Active community
✓ Lots of features

WHAT GHL DOES POORLY:
✗ Page builder feels dated
✗ Steep learning curve
✗ AI features feel bolted on
✗ No real custom app building
✗ Complex workflow system
✗ Slow to innovate

WHO SHOULD USE GHL:
- Agencies focused on marketing automation
- People already deep in the ecosystem
- Those who need the specific integrations

WHO SHOULD LOOK ELSEWHERE:
- Agencies wanting to build custom apps
- Anyone who values simplicity
- People who want AI-native tools
- Those tired of the learning curve

I switched to Layer Cake.
Not because GHL is bad. Because something better exists now.

```

Show Them What's Next.
```

```

```

## Objection Handling Updates

### "My audience loves GoHighLevel"

**Old response:**
```
Layer Cake isn't a competitor — it's complementary.
```

**New response:**
```
Some will stay with GHL. That's fine.

But there's a growing group frustrated with the complexity,
the outdated page builder, the lack of real AI.

Those are your buyers.

You're not convincing GHL fans to switch.
You're reaching the people ready for something better.
```

### "GHL has a bigger ecosystem"

```
Bigger isn't always better.

GHL's ecosystem is also its weakness — bloat, complexity, legacy decisions.

Layer Cake is lean. Modern. AI-native.

You're not selling "more features."
You're selling "finally, something simpler that works."
```

### "Won't GHL affiliates hate me?"

```
You're not attacking GHL. You're offering an alternative.

Some people need GHL. Some people need Layer Cake.

The affiliates making real money aren't threatened by alternatives —
they promote what works for different audiences.

And frankly, the GHL affiliate space is saturated.
Layer Cake affiliate space? Wide open.
```

Title: Honest comparison: GoHighLevel vs Layer Cake for agencies in 2025

---

I've used both. Here's my take.

BACKGROUND:
Ran a marketing agency for 5 years.
Used GHL for 3 of those years.
Now building with Layer Cake.

---

GOHIGHLEVEL

Pros:
- True all-in-one (CRM, email, SMS, funnels, websites)
- White-label is solid
- Huge community and support
- Tons of templates and snapshots
- Proven — thousands of agencies use it

Cons:
- Learning curve is STEEP (took me 3+ weeks to feel comfortable)
- Page builder feels dated
- AI features feel bolted on, not native
- Can't build real custom apps
- Gets complex fast

Best for:
- Marketing agencies focused on funnels + automations
- People who want proven/established
- Those who need specific integrations

---

LAYER CAKE

Pros:
- AI-native (built from scratch with AI)
- Page builder is actually modern
- Can build real custom apps (auth, payments, multi-tenancy)
- Simpler to learn
- Replaces multiple tools (CRM, forms, pages, payments)

Cons:
- Newer (less proven)
- Smaller community
- Some features still rolling out (email/SMS coming)

Best for:
- Agencies wanting to build custom apps for clients
- People frustrated with GHL complexity
- Those who want AI-native, not AI bolt-on
- Agencies delivering software, not just funnels

---

MY TAKE:

If you're happy with GHL and it's working, stay.

If you're frustrated with the complexity, want real AI capabilities,
or want to build actual apps for clients — try Layer Cake.

I made the switch. Delivery is faster. Fewer tools to manage.

Happy to answer questions.

## Twitter Thread: "Why I Left GoHighLevel"

```
1/

I used GoHighLevel for 3 years.

Last month, I switched to Layer Cake.

Here's why:

🧵

---

2/

First — GHL is a good tool.

I'm not here to trash it.

But after 3 years, I started seeing the cracks.

---

3/

Crack #1: The page builder

GHL's page builder works. But it feels like 2018.

Drag and drop. Manual styling. Slow.

Layer Cake: Tell the AI what you want. It builds it.

Night and day.

---

4/

Crack #2: The learning curve

GHL has a million features.

Sounds great until you're 3 weeks in, still watching YouTube tutorials
on how to set up a basic automation.

Layer Cake: Simpler by design. I was productive in days, not weeks.

---

5/

Crack #3: AI is bolted on

GHL added AI features.
But they feel like an afterthought.

Layer Cake was BUILT on AI from day one.

There's a difference between "has AI" and "is AI-native."

---

6/

Crack #4: No custom app building

GHL is great for funnels and marketing automation.

But when a client says "build me an app with login, payments, and a dashboard"?

GHL can't do that. Layer Cake can.

---

7/

Crack #5: The complexity tax

Every month, I spent hours just managing GHL.

Fixing broken automations. Updating workflows. Troubleshooting.

Layer Cake: Less to break. More time for actual work.

---

8/

The result:

€300/month saved (plus the other tools I dropped)
Faster delivery to clients
Less time on setup, more time on results

---

9/

Should YOU switch?

If GHL is working for you → stay.

If you're frustrated with complexity, want real AI, or want to build apps → try Layer Cake.

I'm not going back.

---

10/

Building in public. Sharing everything.

Follow for more.
