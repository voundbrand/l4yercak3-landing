# The Layer Cake Founder Story

> Remington's journey from software engineer → agency owner → back to builder

## The Short Version (30 seconds)

I ran a marketing agency for five years. €240k in revenue, four employees, six clients who loved us. And I took home nothing. The software stack and delivery time ate all the profit. My wife told me to shut it down. So I did — and I built Layer Cake: the tool that would've saved my agency.

## The Full Story

### Chapter 1: The Gap

I was a software engineer. A good one. But I had a problem: I could build anything, but I had no idea how to sell it. I'd never learned marketing. Never learned sales. I'd just... build things and hope someone would notice.

Then I had a newborn, took some time off, and when I came back to the workforce, I made a decision. Instead of going back to engineering, I was going to learn the skills I'd been avoiding my whole career.

Around that time, I read Alex Hormozi's *$100 Million Offers*. It hit me like a truck. I realized just how big my knowledge gap was. Marketing wasn't just "something other people did" — it was a skill I desperately needed.

So I decided to learn it the hard way: by starting from scratch.

---

### Chapter 2: The Agency

I started a social media marketing agency. A friend needed help running ads to recruit employees, and I figured — why not? I'll learn by doing.

And I did learn. Over five years, I built the agency up to **€240,000 a year in recurring revenue**. I had **four employees**. We had **six or seven big clients** — running everything from websites to ads to funnels. The whole deal.

We never went niche-specific. We just helped businesses grow. And our clients loved us.

But here's what nobody tells you about running an agency:

**The software costs are brutal.**

Every month, I was spending **€500 to €1,000** just on tools. GoHighLevel. HubSpot. Form builders. CRMs. Page builders. Email tools. The stack never ended.

And that wasn't even the real problem.

---

### Chapter 3: The Delivery Problem

The real problem was **delivery**.

Every time we onboarded a new client, it took **weeks** to get them fully set up. Connect this integration. Set up that automation. Build this funnel. Configure that CRM.

My team was working full bore. Four employees going hard. And still — onboarding a new customer was a massive time investment.

**Delivery was the bottleneck.**

Our clients were happy. Our team was talented. But by the time I paid my employees and paid for all the software licenses...

I was breaking even.

**€20,000 a month in revenue. And I took home nothing.**

For years, I kept thinking I'd figure it out. Scale more. Optimize more. Hire smarter. But the math never worked. The software costs and the delivery time ate everything.

### Chapter 4: The Car Conversation

**February 2024.** I'm on vacation with my wife in California.

We're sitting in the car outside a restaurant, waiting for our reservation. And we start talking about the business.

I tell her the truth: "It's not working. I'm creating a ton of work for everyone — my team, my clients, myself — but I'm not getting anything out of it. Five years, and I'm still breaking even."

She looked at me and said:

**"Then just shut it down."**

Five years of my life. Building something from nothing. Learning everything the hard way. And that was it.

But she was right.

---

### Chapter 5: Back to Building

So I shut it down.

One of my employees took over the existing clients and kept the agency going. I stepped away and went back to what I knew: **software engineering**.

But I'd been out of the game for five years. A lot had changed — and not just because of AI. The tools were different. The deployment pipelines were different. The languages and frameworks had evolved.

I learned Next.js. I learned the new way of deploying software. And honestly? It was exciting. The ecosystem had gotten *so much better* while I was away.

And then there was AI.

ChatGPT had come out, and I knew immediately — this wasn't a trend. As an engineer, I could see this was a **fundamental shift** in how software gets built. I needed to be part of it.

So I dove in. I started learning. Building. Experimenting.

And for the first time in years, I felt that spark again.

---

### Chapter 6: The Realization

I still had good relationships with some of my old clients. And one of them needed an event management tool built.

So I started building it. And as I was building, I kept thinking about all those years running the agency. All that marketing experience. All those tools I used to pay for.

An event is really just another marketing campaign. If people don't show up, the event fails. So every good event tool needs marketing built in — landing pages, forms, email sequences, payments.

And then it hit me:

**All those tools I was paying €1,000/month for? I could build them myself.**

CRM. Form builder. Page builder. Checkout. Invoicing. Messaging. Communications.

With AI accelerating my development speed, I could build all of it. Not in years — in months.

So that's what I started doing.

---

### Chapter 7: Layer Cake

I called it **Layer Cake**.

Because there are so many layers to software. So many layers to marketing. And what I was building was a way to stack all those layers together — into one platform.

Layer Cake is everything I wished I had when I was running my agency:

- **Page builder** — with AI, connected to real data
- **CRM** — built in, not bolted on
- **Forms** — native, not another integration
- **Payments & checkout** — Stripe, invoicing, the works
- **Messaging & communications** — email, SMS, chat
- **Multi-tenancy** — organizations, sub-organizations, white-labeling

In five minutes, I can create a prototype, connect it to a real backend, and deliver it to a client.

**That's the delivery problem — solved.**

The tool that would've turned my €20k/month agency from "breaking even" to "actually profitable."

---

### Chapter 8: Why This Matters

I spent five years learning what most agency owners learn the hard way:

**You can get clients. You can do great work. You can have a talented team.**

**But if your delivery costs too much — in time, in software, in complexity — you'll never make money.**

Layer Cake fixes that.

And now I want to get it into the hands of every agency owner, freelancer, and builder who's living the same problem I lived.

1. **Reading $100M Offers** — realized the marketing gap
2. **Hitting €240k ARR** — looked like success, wasn't
3. **The car conversation** — wife says "shut it down"
4. **ChatGPT release** — saw the opportunity, dove back into software
5. **Building the event tool** — realized he could replace the whole stack

### The Epiphany Moment
> California. February 2024. Sitting in the car with my wife outside a restaurant, waiting for our reservation. She said, "Then just shut it down." Five years — and that was the moment everything changed.

### The Villain
The **$1,000/month software stack** and the **delivery problem** that made every new client unprofitable. Happy customers, hardworking team, zero profit.

### The Transformation
From **breaking even at €20k/month** → to **building in 5 minutes what used to take 2 weeks**.

### The Mission
Get Layer Cake into the hands of every agency owner who's living the same problem.
