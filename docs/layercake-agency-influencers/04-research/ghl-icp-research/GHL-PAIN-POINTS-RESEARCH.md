---

## Pain Point Categories

### 1. PERFORMANCE & SPEED (Critical)

**The Problem:** Platform is unbearably slow, impacting daily work

**User Quotes:**
- "It takes at least 5 seconds, sometimes 10-20 seconds, to load any page. It is an infrastructure problem and, possibly, bloated code."
- "Load times are AWFUL still... 4 years later."
- "The platform has become very slow during normal daily use — switching between tabs, opening contacts, pipelines, and automations takes significantly longer than expected."
- "Users comparing it to Pipedrive, Coda, and Notion note 'the performance difference is huge' with those tools running 'extremely fast, while HighLevel currently feels heavy and delay-prone.'"
- "For sales teams who already dislike using CRMs, the slow performance in both the Opportunities (Kanban and List view) and Contacts/Messaging areas is very frustrating."
- "The whole site randomly becomes unclickable about 50% of the time when loading a page."
- "I can't resell this buggy thing to customers it will ruin my brand."

**Attack Angle for Layer Cake:**
> "Tired of waiting 10 seconds for every click? Layer Cake was built for speed."

---

### 2. PAGE BUILDER / UI (Critical)

**The Problem:** Outdated, clunky, not modern

**User Quotes:**
- "The HighLevel website builder is not cute. It's functional, but not beautiful. The templates are outdated, and unless you spend time customizing them, your pages may look like everyone else's."
- "It's not the prettiest page builder, and there's a learning curve."
- "Coming from Keap where everything was seamless and intuitive, GoHighLevel's learning curve felt steep and complicated."
- "The backend feels dated and not as intuitive."
- "Menus are everywhere, and some parts of the dashboard feel outdated or harder to navigate than they should be. It works, but it's not exactly a smooth experience."
- "The UI feels clunky. Support can be slow."
- "A few tools occasionally feel buggy or slow, especially when working with workflows or page builder elements."

**Attack Angle for Layer Cake:**
> "GHL's page builder was built for 2018. Layer Cake's was built for 2025 — AI-native, modern, fast."

---

### 3. LEARNING CURVE & COMPLEXITY (High)

**The Problem:** Takes weeks to become productive, overwhelming features

**User Quotes:**
- "GoHighLevel has a steep learning curve and takes time to get used to all features and capabilities."
- "Overwhelming dashboard: Many users feel paralyzed by how many features exist, especially with no onboarding tailored to non-agency users."
- "The learning curve takes some effort to overcome—especially if you're not acquainted with this type of software. New users can quickly get overwhelmed with the sheer number of features and be put off from using the platform."
- "Simple tasks like editing workflows involved digging through menu systems that were all over the place."
- "Most users reach practical results in 1 to 3 weeks."
- "GoHighLevel is not hard, it is broad. Learning everything at once is the main mistake."
- "HighLevel was built with agencies in mind, so solopreneurs and coaches may feel the tool is 'too big' unless they're supported by an expert."

**Time Investment Mentioned:**
- "30-40 tedious hours of setup work transitioning everything over"
- "1 to 3 weeks to reach practical results"
- "3+ weeks to feel comfortable"

**Attack Angle for Layer Cake:**
> "GHL takes 3 weeks to learn. Layer Cake takes 3 days. Because AI handles the complexity."

---

### 4. SUPPORT QUALITY (High)

**The Problem:** Support has degraded, slow responses, unhelpful

**User Quotes:**
- "Support went from horrific, to good once you can talk to someone then to, terrible. This is frustrating and ridiculous... Support has been horrific. That's the precise language for it."
- "They used to have fantastic support that really knew what they were doing and now if you get tier 1 support on the line, they're so confused that they have to make a ticket."
- "Once you get a ticket made, whoever picks up the ticket DOES NOT watch the looms or the info provided."
- "Yes, I just switched to GHL and I've been shocked how bad the chat and email support is. Chat doesn't help they seem to just want to create a ticket and then it takes a week or more for them to respond."
- "The support was not only slow but often failed to resolve ongoing issues effectively."

**Attack Angle for Layer Cake:**
> "With Layer Cake, you get direct access to the founder. Not a ticket queue."

---

### 5. BUGS & RELIABILITY (High)

**The Problem:** Automations fail, features break, unreliable

**User Quotes:**
- "Watch out for those surprise charges for email sending too. They've caught many users off guard."
- "The autosave feature has been a major issue. Users report they can't type 5 characters in a row without autosave kicking in and pausing the whole screen, making it 'almost unworkable'."
- "Users have reported serious automation glitches, including emails being sent to the wrong users multiple times."
- "A lot of users have run into issues with email deliverability or text messages not sending properly."
- "Sometimes the automations don't fire the way they should, especially if you don't have everything set up just right."
- "Technical glitches with unexpected bugs and email mishaps disrupting established customer communications."
- "It only took me about a month of hands-on use to realize I had made a big mistake. The issues started piling up quickly, until it reached a point I had to cut my losses and switch back to Keap entirely."
- "Technologically glitchy and unreliable, almost like the Walmart of CRM platforms."

**Attack Angle for Layer Cake:**
> "GHL adds features. Layer Cake builds stability. One platform that just works."

---

### 6. EMAIL DELIVERABILITY (Medium-High)

**The Problem:** Emails don't reach inboxes, relies on Mailgun with shared IPs

**User Quotes:**
- "Many users report deliverability issues with the email functionality."
- "The email service relies on Mailgun, and people transitioning from other email marketing software to GoHighLevel report a significant drop in email deliverability."
- "A significant con that may eventually force you out of GHL."
- "It's hard to keep email domains healthy because they share email servers with many IP addresses."
- "If you are committing to it, be also ready to shell out extra money on a separate email marketing software because of deliverability issues and bugs."

**Attack Angle for Layer Cake:**
> "Your emails should reach your clients. Layer Cake doesn't share IP pools with thousands of other accounts."

---

### 7. HIDDEN COSTS (Medium)

**The Problem:** Unexpected charges beyond subscription

**User Quotes:**
- "GoHighLevel's email marketing has significant hidden costs—users pay $0.01 per email beyond plan limits, which 'adds up fast with larger lists.'"
- "Some users have reported billing issues after trial cancellation."
- "Watch out for those surprise charges for email sending too."

**Attack Angle for Layer Cake:**
> "€499/month. Everything included. No surprise charges."

---

### 8. RESELLING BURDEN (Medium)

**The Problem:** When you white-label, you become tech support

**User Quotes:**
- "The problem with GoHighLevel comes at the expense of certain things, such as you providing a sub account to a client, you become their software provider as well, which means you will have to take care of certain technical things as set up, building workflows, training AI."
- "It's not possible to just simply CANCEL a payment plan of one of my customers. I have to leave GHL, go to stripe, and do it there. Very non-intuitive."
- "Stripe and PayPal in general just seem super INDEPENDENT of GHL as opposed to working cohesively."

**Attack Angle for Layer Cake:**
> "White-label without the headache. Layer Cake's multi-tenancy is built in, not bolted on."

---

### 9. AI CAPABILITIES (Medium)

**The Problem:** AI features feel like an afterthought

**User Quotes:**
- "AI features feel bolted on, not native."
- "GHL added AI features. But they feel like an afterthought."

**Attack Angle for Layer Cake:**
> "GHL added AI. Layer Cake was BUILT on AI. There's a difference."
