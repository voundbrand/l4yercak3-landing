## The Strategy

### Phase 1: Reddit Blitz (Weeks 1-4)
**Goal:** 100 users from organic Reddit content

- 3 accounts, 7-day warmup
- 8 posts over 4 weeks
- Indirect attack strategy (problem-focused, not competitor-named)
- Upvote group coordination (Chuck's group)

**Key docs:**
- [Reddit Posts](./01-content/reddit/REDDIT-POSTS-INDIRECT.md)
- [Execution Calendar](./01-content/reddit/REDDIT-BLITZ-CALENDAR.md)

### Phase 2: Affiliate Launch (Week 5+)
**Goal:** Recruit influencers with proof from Phase 1

Armed with:
- 100+ users
- Reddit post screenshots
- User testimonials

**Key docs:**
- [Influencer Outreach](./02-outreach/OUTREACH-INFLUENCERS.md)
- [Affiliate Landing Page](./01-content/landing-pages/AFFILIATE-LANDING-PAGE-V2.md)

---

## Key Positioning

**Indirect attack phrases (use these):**
- "Pages that take 10 seconds to load"
- "3-week learning curves"
- "All-in-one that needs 5 other tools"
- "Page builders built for 2018"
- "Support that went from great to 'submit a ticket'"

**Avoid:**
- Naming GHL directly (except 1-2 SEO pieces)
- Attacking competitors by name in Reddit posts

---

## Commission Structure

- **40% recurring lifetime** commission
- **90-day cookie** window
- Paid monthly via Stripe
- No cap on earnings

---

## Affiliate Earnings Potential

| Referrals | Monthly | Yearly |
|-----------|---------|--------|
| 1 | ~€200 | €2,400 |
| 10 | ~€2,000 | €24,000 |
| 50 | ~€10,000 | €120,000 |
