## 2. STAKES (The GHL Problem)

### Section Header:
```
GoHighLevel Was Built for 2018.
Your Audience Deserves Better.
```

### Body:
```
Let's be honest about GHL:

→ The learning curve is brutal (3+ weeks to feel comfortable)
→ The page builder feels dated
→ AI features are bolted on, not native
→ It can't build real custom apps
→ €297-497/month for complexity

Your audience is paying for a tool that's showing its age.

They're watching tutorials for hours.
They're wrestling with workflows.
They're wondering if there's something better.

There is.
```

## 3. VALUE PROPOSITION (The Layer Cake Difference)

### Section Header:
```

## 5. GUIDE (The Story — Updated)

### Section Header:
```
I Used GHL for 3 Years. Then I Built the Replacement.
```

### Body:
```
I'm Remington.

I ran a marketing agency for 5 years. €240k/year revenue.
4 employees. Great clients.

And I took home nothing.

Every month: €1,000 in software (GHL, HubSpot, form builders, the whole stack).
Every new client: 2 weeks to onboard.

GHL was supposed to simplify things. Instead, I spent hours
watching tutorials, fixing workflows, managing complexity.

My wife told me to shut the agency down. So I did.

Then I asked myself:
What if I built what GHL should be?

AI-native. Simpler. Actually fast to learn.
One platform that does everything — including custom app building.

That's Layer Cake.

The tool I wish existed when I was running my agency.
The tool your audience is searching for right now.

## 10. FAQ (Updated for GHL Angle)

### Section Header:
```
Questions
```

**Q: Isn't GHL already established? Why would people switch?**
```
Established doesn't mean best.

GHL was built for 2018. It's powerful, but it's complex.
The page builder is dated. AI is bolted on. Learning curve is brutal.

There's a growing group of agency owners frustrated with GHL.
They're searching for alternatives right now.

You're not convincing happy GHL users to switch.
You're reaching the people ready for something better.
```

**Q: What if my audience already uses GHL?**
```
Even better.

They already understand the category.
They already pay for software.
They already know the pain points.

All you have to do is show them the alternative.
```

**Q: Won't GHL affiliates be angry?**
```
You're not attacking GHL. You're offering a choice.

Some people need GHL. Some people need Layer Cake.
You're serving the ones who need Layer Cake.

And honestly — the GHL affiliate space is overcrowded.
Layer Cake affiliate space is wide open.
```

**Q: What makes Layer Cake actually better?**
```
Three things:

1. AI-native
   GHL added AI features. Layer Cake was BUILT on AI.
   Describe what you want. It builds it.

2. Simpler
   GHL takes 3+ weeks to learn.
   Layer Cake takes days.

3. Custom apps
   GHL does funnels and automations.
   Layer Cake does that PLUS real custom app building
   (auth, payments, dashboards, multi-tenancy).

It's the evolution, not just an alternative.
```

**Q: What about features GHL has that Layer Cake doesn't?**
```
GHL has more features today. No question.

Layer Cake is focused on what agencies actually need in 2025:
AI-powered building, fast delivery, and simplicity.

Multi-channel comms, email, SMS — those are on the roadmap.

You're promoting the future, not the past.
```

**Q: Cookie window?**
```
90 days. 3x longer than most programs.

Someone clicks, forgets for 2 months, comes back and buys —
you still get credit.
```
