## The Story Elements

**The Epiphany Moment:**
California. Car. Wife. "Just shut it down."

**The Villain:**
The $1,000/month software stack + the delivery problem that ate all the profit.

**The Hero (for affiliates):**
Your audience IS Remington from 5 years ago. Agency owners bleeding money on tools, drowning in delivery, breaking even despite good revenue.

**The Transformation:**
From breaking even at €20k/month → to building in 5 minutes what used to take 2 weeks.

---

## HOOK (0:00 - 0:30)

```
I ran a marketing agency for five years.

€240,000 a year in revenue. Four employees. Six big clients.

And I took home... nothing.

I'm going to tell you why — and why I built the tool that would've
saved my business.

If you have an audience of agency owners, freelancers, or anyone
building software for clients... this is how you help them —
and make 40% recurring while you do it.
```

**Why this works:**
- Pattern interrupt: "€240k revenue... took home nothing"
- Immediately relatable to target audience
- Stakes are clear from second one

---

## RETAIN #1: The Real Story (0:30 - 2:00)

```
Five years ago, I was a software engineer who'd never learned to sell.

I read $100 Million Offers, realized I had a massive gap,
and decided to fix it by building an agency from scratch.

Social media marketing. Ads. Funnels. Websites. The whole deal.

And it worked — kind of.

I got to €20,000 a month in revenue.
I had four employees. Six or seven clients who loved us.

But here's what nobody tells you about running an agency:

Every single month, I was spending €500 to €1,000
just on software. GoHighLevel. HubSpot. Form builders.
CRMs. Page builders. The stack never ends.

And every time I onboarded a new client?
It took WEEKS to get them set up.

Connect this. Integrate that. Build this funnel.
Set up this automation.

Delivery was the problem.

My clients were happy. My team was working hard.
But by the time I paid my employees and paid for all the software...

I was breaking even.

Twenty thousand euros a month in revenue — and I took home nothing.
```

**Pause. Let it land.**

```
February 2024. I'm on vacation with my wife in California.

We're sitting in the car outside a restaurant,
waiting for our reservation.

And we're having the conversation. You know the one.

"The business isn't working. I'm creating a ton of work for everyone,
but I'm not getting anything out of it."

She looked at me and said: "Then just shut it down."

Five years of my life. And that was it.
```

**Delivery notes:**
- This is the emotional core. Slow down.
- "Then just shut it down" — pause after this line.
- Let the audience feel the weight before moving forward.

---

## RETAIN #2: The Pivot + The Build (2:00 - 2:45)

```
So I did.

I went back to what I knew — building software.

And I realized something.

All those tools I was paying $1,000 a month for?
CRM. Forms. Page builder. Checkout. Invoicing. Communications.

With AI, I could build them myself.

Not in years. In months.

So that's what I did.

I built Layer Cake.

One platform. Everything an agency needs to deliver.
Page builder. CRM. Forms. Payments. Messaging. AI built in.

The tool I wish I had when I was running my agency.

The tool that would've turned my €20k/month
from "breaking even" to "actually profitable."
```

---

## RETAIN #3: The Affiliate Opportunity (2:45 - 3:30)

**Shift — now make the AFFILIATE the hero**

```
Here's why I'm telling you this.

Your audience? They're me five years ago.

Agency owners drowning in software costs.
Freelancers spending more time on setup than on actual work.
Builders who can prototype in an hour but take two weeks to deliver.

You've probably heard them complain about this.
You've probably felt it yourself.

And now there's a tool that fixes it.

I'm looking for 20 affiliates to help me launch Layer Cake.

Not because I need marketing help —
because I need people who understand this problem.

People whose audience lives this problem every day.

If that's you, here's what I'm offering.
```

---

## REWARD: The Offer (3:30 - 4:15)

```
40% recurring commission. For life.

Not 10%. Not "for the first year."
40% of every payment, every month, as long as they're a customer.

Layer Cake is €499 a month.
That's €200 per customer. Every month. Forever.

Refer 10 customers? That's €2,000 a month in passive income.

90-day cookie window — 3x longer than most programs.

Founding affiliate status for the first 20 partners.
That means a €100 bonus on top of your commission for every first sale.

Plus: demo account, marketing materials, direct access to me.

This isn't some faceless affiliate program.
I review every application personally.
I want partners who get it — who've lived this problem or seen their audience live it.
```

---

## Why This Version Works

| Element | V1 (Before) | V2 (After) |
|---------|-------------|------------|
| **Hook** | Math only | Math + vulnerability ("took home nothing") |
| **Origin** | Generic "I watched agencies struggle" | Real story: €240k, 4 employees, breaking even |
| **Epiphany** | None | California. Car. Wife. "Shut it down." |
| **Villain** | Vague | $1k/month software stack + delivery problem |
| **Affiliate as hero** | Weak | "Your audience is me 5 years ago" |
| **Emotional stakes** | Low | High — felt failure, rebuilt, now offering the solution |

---

## Production Notes

### Key Moments to Nail

1. **"And I took home... nothing."** — Pause. Let it land.
2. **"Then just shut it down."** — This is the emotional peak. Slow way down.
3. **"Your audience? They're me five years ago."** — Direct eye contact. This is the bridge to the affiliate.

### B-Roll Suggestions

- Stock footage: someone working late, stressed
- Your actual Layer Cake dashboard
- Before/after: complex software stack → single dashboard
- California imagery (optional, subtle)

### Tone

- Not polished. Not salesy.
- Founder talking to potential partners.
- Vulnerable but confident.
- "I've been where your audience is. I built the thing that would've saved me."
