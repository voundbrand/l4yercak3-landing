## Thread 1: The Revenue Trap

```
1/

I made €240,000/year running a marketing agency.

I took home €0.

Here's what nobody tells you about the agency business:

🧵

---

2/

For 5 years, I ran a social media marketing agency.

Ads. Funnels. Websites. The whole deal.

At our peak:
• €20k/month revenue
• 4 employees
• 6 clients who loved us

Looked successful. Wasn't.

---

3/

Every month, I spent €500-1,000 on software:

• GoHighLevel
• HubSpot
• Form builders
• Page builders
• Email tools
• Zapier
• The stack never ended

That's €12k/year before I did anything.

---

4/

But software wasn't the real killer.

DELIVERY was.

Every new client took 2 weeks to set up.

• Connect integrations
• Build automations
• Set up funnels
• Configure CRM

2 weeks of work before I made a dollar.

---

5/

By the time I paid my team and paid for software...

I was breaking even.

€20k/month in revenue.
€0 in profit.

For 5 years.

---

6/

February 2024.

Sitting in a car with my wife in California.

Waiting for dinner reservation.

I finally said it out loud:

"This isn't working. I'm creating work for everyone, but I'm not getting anything out of it."

---

7/

She looked at me and said:

"Then shut it down."

5 years.
€240k/year.
4 employees.

And that was the moment.

---

8/

So I did.

Shut down the agency.
Went back to building software.
Started coding again.

And realized something:

All those tools I was paying €1k/month for?

With AI, I could build them myself.

---

9/

That's what I'm doing now.

Building the tool I wish I had when I was running my agency.

One platform. Everything an agency needs.

2 days to deliver what used to take 2 weeks.

---

10/

What I learned:

Revenue is vanity. Profit is sanity.

If your delivery costs more than your margins — in time, tools, complexity — you'll never make money.

Took me 5 years to figure that out.

Don't make my mistake.

---

11/

If you're running an agency and this hit home, follow me.

I'm building in public and sharing everything I learn.

## Thread 2: The Wife Story

```
1/

My wife told me to shut down my business.

She was right.

Here's the story:

🧵

---

2/

February 2024.

California.

We're sitting in a rental car outside a restaurant, waiting for our reservation.

I'd been running a marketing agency for 5 years.

---

3/

The business looked great on paper:

• €240k/year revenue
• 4 employees
• 6 happy clients

But I was exhausted.

---

4/

Every month: €1,000 in software costs.

Every new client: weeks of setup.

Every paycheck: barely enough after paying the team.

I was working harder than anyone. And breaking even.

---

5/

I finally said it out loud:

"This isn't working. I'm creating a ton of work for everyone, but I'm not getting anything out of it."

---

6/

She didn't try to fix it.

She didn't suggest optimizations.

She just said:

"Then shut it down."

---

7/

5 years.
€240k/year.
4 employees.

And that was the moment I realized she was right.

---

8/

So I did.

I went back to software engineering.

I started building again.

And I realized something that changed everything:

---

9/

All those tools I was paying €1,000/month for?

• CRM
• Form builder
• Page builder
• Payments
• Messaging

With AI, I could build them myself.

---

10/

So that's what I'm doing now.

Building the tool that would've saved my agency.

One platform. Everything. 2-day delivery instead of 2 weeks.

---

11/

Some days I miss having clients.

Most days I don't miss the delivery grind.

If you're running an agency and this resonates — I'm sharing the whole journey here.

Follow along.

## Thread 3: The Tool Stack Breakdown

```
1/

I spent €12,000/year on SaaS tools running my agency.

Here's the full breakdown:

🧵

---

2/

For 5 years, I ran a marketing agency.

Ads, funnels, websites for clients.

€240k/year revenue.

And a tool stack that ate my margins alive.

---

3/

Monthly software costs:

• GoHighLevel: €297
• HubSpot: €150
• Typeform: €59
• Webflow: €49
• Calendly: €15
• Slack: €50
• Notion: €20
• Zapier: €89
• Email tool: €100
• Random other stuff: €150

---

4/

Total: €979/month

That's €11,748/year.

Before I paid a single employee.

Before I paid myself (lol).

Before any actual operating costs.

---

5/

At €20k/month revenue, my software stack was eating 5% off the top.

Then add delivery time:

Every new client = 2 weeks to set up.

That's labor cost too.

---

6/

By the time I did the math honestly...

I was breaking even.

On a "successful" agency.

---

7/

What would I do differently?

1. Consolidate tools earlier (one platform, not 10)
2. Charge more for onboarding (I ate that cost)
3. Productize delivery (same setup for every client)

---

8/

I shut the agency down last year.

My wife told me to.

She was right.

---

9/

Now I'm building the tool I wish existed.

One platform. Everything an agency needs.

No more €1k/month in subscriptions.
No more 2-week onboarding.

---

10/

If your margins are getting eaten by software costs, you're not alone.

I'm sharing the whole build journey here.

## Thread 4: The Delivery Problem

```
1/

Every new client cost me 2 weeks of work before I made a dollar.

Here's how "delivery" kills agencies:

🧵

---

2/

I ran a marketing agency for 5 years.

€240k/year revenue.

4 employees.

And a delivery problem that almost bankrupted me.

---

3/

Here's what "delivery" actually looks like:

New client signs → 2 weeks of setup:

• Connect their accounts
• Set up CRM
• Build landing pages
• Create automations
• Configure forms
• Integrate payments

---

4/

That's 2 weeks of labor.

Minimum 40-60 hours from my team.

Before the client pays for anything.

Before we do any actual work.

---

5/

We charged €2,000/month retainers.

But if onboarding took €1,500 worth of labor...

It took 3+ months to break even on each client.

Assuming they didn't churn.

---

6/

The brutal math:

• €20k/month revenue
• €8k/month in salaries
• €1k/month in software
• Onboarding costs on top

Breaking even. Every month. For 5 years.

---

7/

My clients were happy.

My team was working hard.

I was taking home nothing.

Delivery was the silent killer.

---

8/

February 2024.

My wife said: "Just shut it down."

So I did.

---

9/

Now I'm building the fix.

A platform where onboarding takes hours, not weeks.

Pre-built modules. Everything connected.

Delivery in 2 days instead of 2 weeks.

---

10/

If you run an agency and delivery is killing your margins:

• Productize your setup
• Charge for onboarding
• Use fewer tools

Or wait until I finish building this thing.

Follow for updates.

## Thread 5: The Comeback

```
1/

I shut down my €240k agency.

6 months later, here's what I built:

🧵

---

2/

Backstory:

• 5 years running marketing agency
• €240k/year revenue
• 4 employees
• €0 profit

Software costs + delivery time = broke even

---

3/

February 2024.

Wife said: "Shut it down."

I did.

Went back to software engineering.

Started building again.

---

4/

But I'd been out of the game for 5 years.

Everything had changed:

• New frameworks
• New deployment tools
• New best practices

And then... AI.

---

5/

ChatGPT. Claude. Cursor.

Everything clicked.

I could build 10x faster than before.

The things that used to take months? Weeks.

---

6/

I realized something:

All those tools I was paying €1k/month for?

• CRM
• Page builder
• Forms
• Payments
• Messaging

I could build them myself.

---

7/

So I did.

6 months of building.

One platform.

Everything an agency needs.

Called it Layer Cake.

---

8/

What it does:

• Page builder with AI
• Built-in CRM
• Forms
• Payments (Stripe)
• Messaging
• Multi-tenancy (white label for clients)

All in one.

---

9/

What used to take me 2 weeks to set up for a client?

Now takes 2 days.

The tool I wish I had when I was running my agency.

---

10/

Now looking for early users and affiliates.

## Thread 6: The AI Build Stack

```
1/

AI let me build in 6 months what would've taken 2 years.

Here's my exact stack:

🧵

---

2/

Background:

I was a software engineer.

Then I ran an agency for 5 years.

Then I went back to building.

But 5 years is a long time in tech.

---

3/

What changed while I was gone:

• Next.js became the standard
• Vercel made deployment trivial
• Tailwind CSS everywhere
• TypeScript is now required
• AI... changed everything

---

4/

My current build stack:

• Next.js (App Router)
• TypeScript
• Tailwind CSS
• Convex (backend)
• Vercel (deployment)
• Cursor (AI coding)
• Claude (thinking partner)

---

5/

How I use Cursor:

It's not "AI writes my code."

It's "AI accelerates my code."

• Tab completion for boilerplate
• Generate components from descriptions
• Debug faster
• Refactor on command

---

6/

How I use Claude:

• Rubber duck debugging
• Architecture decisions
• "Is this the right approach?"
• Documentation
• Thinking through problems

---

7/

What would've taken 2 years:

• Page builder
• CRM
• Forms
• Payments
• Messaging
• Multi-tenancy
• AI features

I built the core in 6 months.

---

8/

The secret:

It's not that AI writes perfect code.

It's that AI removes the friction.

Less Googling.
Less boilerplate.
Less context switching.

More building.

---

9/

What I'm building:

Layer Cake.

The tool I wish I had when I ran my agency.

One platform. Everything. Delivery in days, not weeks.

---

10/

If you're building with AI — share your stack in replies.

If you want to follow the build — I'm posting here.

Let's go.

## Thread 7: Lessons From Failure

```
1/

I failed at running an agency for 5 years.

Here's the one thing I'd change:

🧵

---

2/

The numbers looked good:

• €240k/year revenue
• 4 employees
• 6 clients

But I was breaking even.

For 5 years.

---

3/

What I tried:

✓ Raised prices
✓ Hired more people
✓ Fired people
✓ Different niches
✓ Different services
✓ More clients
✓ Fewer clients

Nothing worked.

---

4/

What was actually wrong:

DELIVERY.

Every new client took 2 weeks to set up.

€1k/month in software to run everything.

The margins were impossible.

---

5/

The one thing I'd change:

Build my own tools from day one.

Instead of paying for 10 SaaS products...

Build one platform that does everything.

---

6/

"But that takes time!"

Yes.

But so does:
• Learning 10 different tools
• Integrating them together
• Paying €12k/year
• Spending 2 weeks on each client setup

---

7/

If I could go back:

Month 1-6: Build the core platform
Month 6+: Scale with zero software costs

Instead of:

Year 1-5: Pay €60k in software
Year 1-5: Waste thousands of hours on delivery
Year 5: Shut down

---

8/

That's what I'm building now.

Layer Cake.

The platform I should've built from day one.

One tool. Everything. 2-day delivery.

---

9/

Lesson:

If you're spending €500+/month on software...

If onboarding takes more than a few days...

Your margins are already broken.

Fix delivery or die slowly.

---

10/

I share what I'm learning here.

Follow if you're building an agency or SaaS.

Don't make my mistakes.
