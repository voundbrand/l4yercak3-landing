## The BrandScript (For This Page)

**Character (Hero):** Agency coach/influencer who wants passive income from affiliate programs

**Problem:**
- External: "Affiliate programs are saturated, low commission, or products that don't convert"
- Internal: "I don't want to promote crap to my audience"
- Philosophical: "Creators who help agency owners deserve to earn real money from quality recommendations"

**Guide:** Layer Cake (Remington) — ran an agency for 5 years, built the tool that fixes the #1 agency problem

**Plan:** Apply → Get approved → Get your link + demo account → Start earning

**CTA:** Apply to become an affiliate

**Success:** Passive income (€2k+/month), audience loves you for the recommendation, founding partner status

**Failure:** Promoting saturated products, competing with everyone, low commissions that don't move the needle

## 2. STAKES (What They Lose)

### Section Header:
```
Tired of Promoting Products That Don't Convert?
```

### Body:
```
Most affiliate programs are broken:

→ Low commissions (10-20%) that barely move the needle
→ Saturated markets where everyone promotes the same thing
→ Products your audience doesn't actually need
→ Cookie windows so short you lose credit on longer sales cycles

You work hard to build trust with your audience.
You shouldn't have to waste it on mediocre recommendations.
```

---

## 3. VALUE PROPOSITION (What They Get)

### Section Header:
```
What If You Could Earn Real Money From Something Your Audience Actually Needs?
```

### Body:
```
Layer Cake is the tool agency owners wish existed.

One platform. Everything they need to deliver client work.
Page builder. CRM. Forms. Payments. Messaging. AI.

Delivery in 2 days instead of 2 weeks.

And for you:

✓ 40% recurring commission — forever
✓ €499/month product = €200/month per referral
✓ 90-day cookie window (3x industry standard)
✓ Founding affiliate bonuses (first 20 only)
✓ A product that actually solves a massive pain point
```

## 4. GUIDE (Why Trust Us)

### Section Header:
```
Built By Someone Who Lived the Problem
```

### Body:
```
I'm Remington. I ran a marketing agency for 5 years.

€240,000/year in revenue. 4 employees. Great clients.

And I took home nothing.

The software stack cost €1,000/month.
Every new client took 2 weeks to onboard.
Delivery ate all my profit.

My wife told me to shut it down. So I did.

Then I built Layer Cake — the tool that would've saved my agency.

Your audience is living what I lived.
They need this. And you can be the one who shows them.

## 7. EXPLANATORY PARAGRAPH

### Section Header:
```
Why 40%? Why Lifetime?
```

### Body:
```
Most SaaS affiliate programs pay 10-25%. For 12 months. With a 30-day cookie.

We do things differently.

40% recurring matches the best in the industry (GoHighLevel).
Lifetime duration means your income compounds forever.
90-day cookies mean you get credit even on longer sales cycles.

Why? Because we'd rather pay you than spend on ads.
And because affiliates who earn real money promote harder.

This isn't a side hustle. This is a business model.

## 9. FAQ (Objection Handling)

### Section Header:
```
Questions You Might Have
```

### FAQs:

**Q: I already promote GoHighLevel. Isn't this competing?**
```
Layer Cake isn't a GHL competitor — it's complementary.

GHL = marketing automation (email, funnels, CRM)
Layer Cake = custom app development (page builder, payments, multi-tenancy)

Your audience needs both. This is additive revenue, not replacement.
Same commission structure, different product.
```

**Q: What if my audience isn't technical?**
```
Perfect. Layer Cake is built for non-technical agency owners.

If your audience has ever:
- Used v0, Lovable, or any prototype tool
- Complained about "the backend part"
- Wanted to offer app development without hiring developers

They need Layer Cake.
```

**Q: What's the cookie window?**
```
90 days.

That's 3x longer than most programs.
Someone clicks your link, forgets for 6 weeks, comes back and buys —
you still get credit.
```

**Q: When and how do I get paid?**
```
Payouts are processed monthly, NET-30.
Minimum payout: €100.

Payment methods:
- PayPal
- Wise (international)
- Direct bank transfer (EU/US)
```

**Q: What marketing materials do I get?**
```
Everything you need:
- Demo account (full access)
- Product demo video
- Swipe copy (email, social)
- Graphics (sized for each platform)
- FAQ document for your audience
```

**Q: I've never heard of Layer Cake. Why should I promote it?**
```
Two reasons:

1. First-mover advantage. Layer Cake is new.
   There's no saturation. You're not competing with 10,000 other affiliates.

2. Founding affiliate terms. The first 20 affiliates get €100 bonus per sale
   and founding partner status. Once those spots fill, terms change.

You can be early, or you can be competing with everyone else later.
