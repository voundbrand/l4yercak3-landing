## Structure Overview

```
[0:00 - 0:30]  HOOK         → Pattern interrupt, bold claim
[0:30 - 1:30]  RETAIN #1    → Origin story (compressed)
[1:30 - 2:30]  RETAIN #2    → Break vehicle belief (why this is different)
[2:30 - 3:30]  RETAIN #3    → Break internal belief (why YOU can do this)
[3:30 - 4:30]  REWARD       → The offer + founding affiliate bonuses
[4:30 - 5:00]  CTA          → Apply now
```

---

## HOOK (0:00 - 0:30)

**Choose your hook based on where the traffic is coming from:**

### Hook A: The Math Hook (Cold traffic, numbers-focused)
```
"10 referrals. $2,000 a month. Forever.

That's not a promise — that's math.

If you've got an audience of agency owners, freelancers, or anyone building software...
I'm about to show you how to turn that audience into recurring passive income.

And not the 'promote this once, make $50' kind.

I'm talking 40% recurring. For life."
```

### Hook B: The Problem Hook (Warm traffic, content-aware)
```
"You already know your audience can build beautiful prototypes with v0 and ChatGPT.

What they CAN'T do? Turn those into real apps.

Authentication. Payments. Databases. Multi-tenancy.

That's where they get stuck.

I built the platform that fixes that — and I'm looking for 20 affiliates to help launch it."
```

### Hook C: The Competitor Angle (GHL audience)
```
"If you're promoting GoHighLevel right now, don't stop.

But your audience has a problem GHL doesn't solve.

They can do marketing automation. They can't build custom software fast.

That's a gap. I filled it. And I'm offering the exact same commission structure — 40% lifetime.

Let me show you what this looks like."
```

---

## RETAIN #1: Origin Story (0:30 - 1:30)

**Goal:** Establish credibility + show you understand their world

```
"Quick story.

I spent years watching agencies struggle with the same problem.

They'd use v0 or Lovable to build a prototype — beautiful frontend, client loves it —
and then spend the next two weeks hacking together authentication, payment flows,
CRM integrations...

Or they'd hire a dev. Wait 6 weeks. Blow the budget.
And end up with something the client wanted changed anyway.

I lived this. I saw it happening to every agency I talked to.

So I built Layer Cake.

It's the backend layer that lets agencies take ANY prototype and connect it to
pre-built modules — auth, Stripe, CRM, database, messaging — in hours, not weeks.

Agencies that used to charge €15,000 for this work now deliver in 2 days for €3,000.
Same profit. 5x less effort.

That's what your audience gets."
```

**Delivery notes:**
- Pace: Conversational, not salesy
- Energy: "Let me tell you what I discovered" vibe
- Visuals: Consider B-roll of v0 prototype → backend code → frustration

---

## RETAIN #2: Break the Vehicle Belief (1:30 - 2:30)

**Belief to break:** "Affiliate programs are oversaturated / don't pay well enough"

```
"Now, I know what you're thinking.

'Another affiliate program. Great. I'll make $50 and never see a commission again.'

Here's why this is different.

First — the commission. 40% recurring, lifetime.

Not 10%. Not 'for the first 6 months.'

40%. Every month. As long as they're a customer.

At $599 a month, that's $240 per customer. Every single month.

Refer 10 customers? That's $2,400 a month in passive income. Forever.

Second — the cookie window. 90 days.

Most programs give you 30 days. Someone clicks your link, forgets about it for 6 weeks,
comes back and buys — you get nothing.

With Layer Cake, you've got 3 months of coverage.

Third — and this is the big one — there's no one else promoting this yet.

GoHighLevel has thousands of affiliates competing for the same audience.

Layer Cake has... almost no one.

You're not fighting for scraps. You're getting in early.

The first 20 affiliates get founding partner status, plus a $100 bonus on every first sale."
```

**Delivery notes:**
- Pace: Speed up slightly here — conviction
- Visuals: Show the math on screen as you say it
- Compare visually to GHL (respectfully — it's complementary, not competitive)

---

## RETAIN #3: Break the Internal Belief (2:30 - 3:30)

**Belief to break:** "I don't have the audience for this / My audience won't buy"

```
"You might be thinking: 'But my audience isn't technical. They won't get this.'

Let me flip that.

If your audience has EVER:
- Used v0, Bolt, Lovable, or Cursor
- Complained about 'the backend part'
- Wished they could deliver apps faster
- Wanted to offer software development but didn't have developers

They need Layer Cake.

You don't need a massive audience. You need an audience that builds.

10 referrals is $2,000/month.

That's one good YouTube video. One email to your list. One podcast mention.

You've probably already talked about the problems Layer Cake solves.
You just didn't have the solution to offer.

Now you do."
```

**Delivery notes:**
- Pace: Slow down for emphasis on the list
- Make eye contact (if teleprompter, look just above camera)
- This is where you connect emotionally — "I see you, I know your audience"

---

## REWARD: The Offer (3:30 - 4:30)

**Goal:** Stack the value, make it feel like a no-brainer

```
"Here's what you get as a Layer Cake affiliate.

40% recurring commission — for life.
$240/month per customer at our standard price.

90-day cookie window.
3x longer than most programs.

Founding affiliate status — for the first 20 partners.
That means a $100 cash bonus on every first sale, on top of your 40%.

Marketing materials.
Demo videos, swipe copy, graphics — everything you need to promote.

A demo account.
Play with the product. Show it to your audience. Build something real.

Direct access to me.
Not a support ticket. A Slack channel. I want you to win.

And remember — this is not competing with what you already promote.

If you're a GHL affiliate, this is additive. Different product, different use case, same audience.

If you're not doing affiliate marketing at all... this is a good one to start with."
```

**Delivery notes:**
- Visuals: Show each benefit on screen as you say it
- Stack the value — pause slightly after each point
- End with the "this is additive" line — important for GHL affiliates

---

## CTA: Apply Now (4:30 - 5:00)

**Goal:** Clear, urgent, low-friction next step

```
"If this sounds interesting, here's what to do.

Click the button below. Fill out the affiliate application.

It takes 2 minutes. I review every application personally.

If we're a fit, I'll send you your affiliate link,
your demo account, and we'll get you set up this week.

We're capping founding affiliates at 20.
Once those spots are filled, the $100 bonus goes away.

I'm not going to hard-sell you. Either this is a fit or it's not.

But if you've got an audience of agency owners, freelancers, or builders —
and you want to earn 40% recurring while helping them solve a real problem...

Click the button. Apply now.

I'll see you on the other side."
```

**Delivery notes:**
- Direct eye contact
- Confident but not pushy
- End with a genuine smile — "I'll see you on the other side" is warm

[HOOK - choose based on traffic source]

10 referrals. $2,000 a month. Forever.

That's not a promise — that's math.

If you've got an audience of agency owners, freelancers,
or anyone building software... I'm about to show you how to
turn that audience into recurring passive income.

And not the 'promote this once, make $50' kind.

I'm talking 40% recurring. For life.

[ORIGIN]

Quick story.

I spent years watching agencies struggle with the same problem.

They'd use v0 or Lovable to build a prototype — beautiful frontend,
client loves it — and then spend the next two weeks hacking together
authentication, payment flows, CRM integrations...

Or they'd hire a dev. Wait 6 weeks. Blow the budget.

Same profit. 5x less effort. That's what your audience gets.

[VEHICLE BELIEF]

Now, I know what you're thinking.

'Another affiliate program. Great. I'll make $50 and never

Here's why this is different.

## Production Notes

2. **B-roll options:**
   - v0/Lovable prototype screen recording
   - Layer Cake dashboard
   - Commission calculator animation

### Text Overlays (For Editing)
- `0:10` — "40% Recurring. Lifetime."
- `0:15` — "$240/mo per customer"
- `1:45` — "40% vs 10% industry average"
- `2:00` — "90-day cookie vs 30-day"

- `3:00` — Checklist of "if your audience has ever..."
- `3:45` — Stack of benefits (visually)

### Music
- Upbeat but not distracting
- Dip under voice, slight swell at CTA

### Runtime Target
- Ideal: 4:00 - 4:30
- Maximum: 5:00
- Hook alone: Must be under 30 seconds

---

## A/B Test Ideas

### Hook Tests
1. Math hook vs Problem hook (see which gets more watch time)
2. Include/exclude "GoHighLevel" mention
3. Start with face vs text overlay

### CTA Tests
1. "Apply now" vs "Get your affiliate link"
2. With/without "20 spots" urgency
3. Add countdown timer below video?

---

## Framework Reference

### Perfect Webinar (Compressed)
- ✅ Origin story (1 min vs 5+ min)
- ✅ Vehicle belief break (affiliate programs work when structured right)
- ✅ Internal belief break (your audience IS right for this)
- ⏭️ External belief (skipped — not needed for short VSL)

### Hormozi Hook/Retain/Reward
- ✅ **Hook:** Pattern interrupt, bold claim (40%, $2k/mo)
- ✅ **Retain:** Story, value, credibility (origin + belief breaks)
- ✅ **Reward:** The offer stacked clearly (commission + bonuses + materials)
