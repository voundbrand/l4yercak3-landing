## Why Reddit Works for Your Story

Your story is BUILT for Reddit:
- €240k revenue, €0 profit ← controversy, relatability
- Wife said "shut it down" ← emotional, vulnerable
- Built the fix yourself ← founder grind, redemption arc
- Specific numbers + proof ← Reddit loves receipts

**Roman's results:** 11M impressions, 40K website visitors, first 100 customers
**Your advantage:** Better story than "I paid influencers" or "YC rejected me"

## Phase 1: Account Setup (Week 1)

### Create 3 Accounts
One per browser — keep them separate:

| Account | Browser | Purpose |
|---------|---------|---------|
| Main | Chrome | Primary posting account |
| Backup 1 | Firefox | Comments + upvote support |
| Backup 2 | Safari | Comments + upvote support |

### Account Creation Rules
- ❌ Do NOT use new email addresses (instant ban)
- ✅ Use existing Gmail/email accounts
- ✅ Add profile picture immediately
- ✅ Link Layer Cake in bio
- ✅ **Enable "hide feed" setting** — so people can't see you always post about same thing

### Warm-Up Period (7-14 days)
Before ANY marketing posts:
- Comment on 5-10 posts per day
- Upvote content genuinely
- Build karma (need ~100+ before posting)
- Be a real person, not a marketer

**Subreddits to warm up in:**
- r/Entrepreneur (comment on others' stories)
- r/SaaS (give genuine advice)
- r/webdev (help people)
- r/startups (engage with founder stories)

## Phase 3: Content Angles

### Your Story = Multiple Posts

**The same story can be told 10 different ways:**

---

### Post 1: The Revenue vs Profit Story
**Title:** `I made €240k/year running an agency. I took home €0. Here's what went wrong.`

**Hook:** The gap between revenue and profit. Every agency owner relates.

**Outline:**
```
- 5 years running marketing agency
- €240k revenue, 4 employees, great clients
- The hidden costs nobody talks about:
  - €500-1,000/month in software (list the tools)
  - Weeks to onboard each client
  - Delivery was the real cost
- The breaking point (wife conversation)
- What I learned
- [Don't pitch — let people ask in comments]
```

---

### Post 2: The Wife Story
**Title:** `My wife told me to shut down my business. She was right.`

**Hook:** Emotional, vulnerable, clickable.

**Outline:**
```

```

---

### Post 3: The Tool Stack Breakdown

  - GoHighLevel: €297
  - HubSpot: €XXX
  - Form builder: €XXX
  - Page builder: €XXX
  - [List everything]
- Total: €1,000/month = €12,000/year

- What I'd do differently
- [In comments: mention you're building an alternative]
```

---

### Post 4: The Delivery Problem

**Hook:** Specific pain point agency owners feel.

**Outline:**
```
- The hidden cost of onboarding

- Why happy clients ≠ profit
- The math that broke my business
- What I'd tell agency owners starting today
```

---

### Post 5: The Pivot Story
**Title:** `I shut down my €240k agency and went back to coding. 6 months later, here's what I built.`

**Hook:** Redemption arc, building in public.

**Outline:**
```
- Background: agency for 5 years
- Why I shut it down (delivery problem)
- Going back to software engineering

- [This one CAN be more direct about the product]
```

---

### Post 6: The AI Angle

**Hook:** AI builders love this content.

**Outline:**
```
- Background: engineer → agency → back to building

- What's still hard
```

---

### Post 7: The Comparison Post

**Hook:** GHL users will click. Not a hit piece — balanced take.

**Outline:**
```
- My agency used GHL for marketing automation
- What it does great (list)
- What it doesn't do (custom app building)
- The gap I kept hitting
- What I'm building to fill that gap
```

---

### Post 8: The Failure Lesson

```

---

## Phase 4: Post Formula

### The Structure That Works

```
[HOOK - First 2 lines visible in feed]
Problem or provocative statement
Specific number or result

[CONTEXT - Who you are]
Brief background (1-2 sentences)
Why you're credible to talk about this

[THE STORY - Meat of the post]
Specific details, numbers, timeline
Vulnerable moments
What went wrong / what happened

[THE LESSON - What you learned]
Insight others can apply
What you'd do differently

[SOFT CTA - Optional, in comments]
Don't put your product in the post
Reply to comments, mention it naturally when asked
```

### Rules

1. **Never put your product link in the post** — triggers spam filters
2. **Put link in bio** — people will check your profile
3. **Reply to EVERY comment** — drives engagement, boosts ranking
4. **Show proof** — screenshots, numbers, specifics
5. **Tell the truth** — Reddit detects BS instantly

---

## Phase 5: The First 10 Minutes

**This is the most important part.**

Reddit algorithm ranks posts by early engagement. You need **10+ upvotes in the first 10 minutes**.

### Option A: Upvote Group (What Roman Does)
- Find 10-15 other founders doing Reddit marketing
- Create a Slack/Discord/WhatsApp group
- When someone posts, everyone upvotes + comments
- Reciprocate for others

**Where to find these people:**
- Indie Hackers community
- Twitter/X founder circles
- r/SaaS itself (DM people who post)
- Starter Story community

### Option B: Your Existing Network
- Text 10 friends when you post
- "Hey, just posted on Reddit — can you upvote?"
- Even non-Reddit users can create accounts and help

### Option C: Multi-Account (Risky)
- Use your backup accounts to upvote
- Be careful — Reddit detects this if done from same IP
- Use different browsers, maybe different networks

---

## Phase 6: Timing

### Best Times to Post
- **Tuesday-Thursday** perform best
- **9-11 AM EST** (catches US morning + Europe afternoon)
- **Avoid weekends** — less traffic

### Frequency
- **Week 1-2:** 1 post (test the waters)
- **Week 3-4:** 2 posts (different angles)
- **Ongoing:** 1-2 posts per week max

Don't spam. Quality > quantity.

---

## Phase 7: Handling Comments

### Positive Comments
```
"Thanks! Yeah, the delivery problem was brutal. Happy to share more about what I'm building now if you're curious."
```

### "What did you build?"
```
"Built a platform called Layer Cake — basically everything an agency needs in one place (page builder, CRM, forms, payments). Still early but getting good traction. Happy to show you if interested."
```

### Skeptical Comments
```
"Fair point. I can only speak to my experience — €240k revenue, 4 employees, broke even. The software costs and delivery time were the killers for me. YMMV."
```

### Haters
- **Block and move on**
- Don't engage with trolls
- Focus on helpful comments

### "This is an ad"
```
"Not trying to sell anything in this post — just sharing what happened. If you want to know what I'm building now, it's in my bio."
```

---

## Phase 8: Post Templates (Copy & Paste)

### Template 1: The Revenue Trap

```
I made €240,000/year running a marketing agency.

I took home nothing.

Here's what nobody tells you about the agency business:

For 5 years, I ran a social media marketing agency. We did ads, funnels, websites — the whole deal.

At our peak:
- €20,000/month in revenue
- 4 employees
- 6 clients who loved us

But every month, I was spending €500-1,000 just on software:
- GoHighLevel
- HubSpot
- Form builders
- Page builders
- Email tools
- The stack never ended

And every time I onboarded a new client? It took WEEKS.

Connect this integration. Set up that automation. Build this funnel.

By the time I paid my team and paid for all the software, I was breaking even.

February 2024, I'm sitting in a car with my wife in California. We're waiting for our dinner reservation. And I finally say it out loud:

"This business isn't working. I'm creating work for everyone, but I'm not getting anything out of it."

She looked at me and said: "Then just shut it down."

5 years of my life. And that was it.

---

What I learned:

Revenue is vanity. Profit is sanity.

If your delivery costs more than your margins can handle — in time, in tools, in complexity — you'll never make money.

Happy to answer questions. I'm building something new now, but that's a story for another post.
```

---

### Template 2: The Wife Story

```
My wife told me to shut down my business.

She was right.

February 2024. California. We're sitting in a rental car outside a restaurant, waiting for our reservation.

I'd been running a marketing agency for 5 years. €240,000/year in revenue. 4 employees. Great clients.

And I was exhausted.

Every month: €1,000 in software costs. Every new client: weeks of setup before I could deliver anything. Every paycheck: barely enough left over after paying the team.

I finally said it out loud:

"This isn't working. I'm creating a ton of work for everyone, but I'm not getting anything out of it."

She didn't try to fix it. She didn't suggest optimizations.

She just said: "Then shut it down."

5 years. €240k/year. 4 employees. And that was the moment I realized she was right.

---

So I did.

I went back to software engineering. Started building again.

And I realized something:

All those tools I was paying €1,000/month for? With AI, I could build them myself.

That's what I'm doing now. Building the tool I wish I had when I was running my agency.

Some days I miss having clients. Most days I don't miss the delivery grind.

Anyone else shut down a business that looked successful on paper?
```

---

### Template 3: The Tool Stack Exposé

```
I spent €12,000/year on SaaS tools running my agency.

Here's the full breakdown (and why it killed my business):

For 5 years, I ran a marketing agency doing ads, funnels, and websites for clients.

My monthly tool stack:
- GoHighLevel: €297
- HubSpot (sales tier): €150
- Typeform: €59
- Webflow: €49
- Calendly: €15
- Slack: €50
- Notion: €20
- Zapier: €89
- Email tool: €100
- Random other stuff: €150

**Total: €979/month = €11,748/year**

And that's before:
- Paying 4 employees
- Paying myself (lol)
- Any actual operating costs

At €20k/month revenue, my software stack was eating 5% before I did anything.

Then factor in delivery time. Every new client took 2 weeks to set up properly. That's labor cost too.

By the time I did the math honestly, I was breaking even. On a "successful" agency.

---

What would I do differently?

1. Consolidate tools earlier (one platform, not 10)
2. Charge more for onboarding (I ate that cost)
3. Productize delivery (same setup for every client)

I shut the agency down last year. Now I'm building the tool I wish existed.

Anyone else have their margins eaten by software costs?
```

## The Unfair Advantage

Your story is better than most Reddit marketing content:

| Typical Reddit Post | Your Story |
|---------------------|------------|
| "I made $10k in a month" | "I made €240k and took home nothing" |
| "I got rejected from YC" | "My wife told me to shut it down" |
| "I built an AI tool" | "I built the tool that would've saved my business" |

**You have real pain, real numbers, and a real transformation.**

That's content gold. Use it.
