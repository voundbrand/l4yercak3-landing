## LinkedIn Sequence (5-Touch)

### Touch 0: Connection Request

**Template A: Story Hook**
```
Hey [Name] — ran a marketing agency for 5 years, €240k revenue, 4 employees.

Took home nothing. The software stack ate everything.

Built the tool that would've saved my business. Looking for affiliates who get it.

Your content shows you do. Connect?
```

**Template B: Recognition + Curiosity**
```
[Name], your [specific video/post] on [topic] nailed it.

I lived that exact problem for 5 years running an agency. Built something that fixes it.

Would love to connect and share what we're doing.
```

---

### Touch 1: The Story (Day 1 after accept)

```
Hey [Name], appreciate the connect.

Quick backstory: I ran a marketing agency for 5 years. €240k in revenue. 4 employees. Great clients.

And I took home nothing.

Every month: €500-1,000 in software (GHL, HubSpot, form builders, the whole stack). And every new client took WEEKS to onboard.

Delivery was killing me. Happy clients, hardworking team, zero profit.

My wife told me to shut it down. So I did.

Then I built Layer Cake — one platform that replaces the entire stack. Page builder, CRM, forms, payments, AI. What used to take 2 weeks now takes 2 days.

The tool I wish I had.

I'm looking for 20 affiliates who understand this problem — because their audience lives it.

Your content tells me you get it. Interested in learning more?
```

---

### Touch 2: The Offer (Day 4)

**If they replied:**
```
Glad this resonates — figured it would.

Here's the affiliate deal:

→ 40% recurring commission, lifetime
→ €499/month product = ~€200/month per referral
→ 10 referrals = €2,000/month passive income

For the first 20 founding affiliates:
→ €100 bonus on every first sale
→ Featured on our affiliate page
→ Custom content for your audience
→ Direct access to me

Want a quick demo? I can show you the product and walk through the setup.
```

**If no reply:**
```
Hey [Name], following up.

The short version: I built the tool that would've saved my agency. Now I'm looking for 20 partners who understand the problem.

40% recurring, lifetime. 10 referrals = €2,000/month.

Your audience is agency owners, freelancers, builders — the exact people I built this for.

Worth a quick chat?
```

---

### Touch 3: Different Angle (Day 10)

**Template A: For GHL Promoters**
```
[Name], one more thought —

I know you promote GoHighLevel. Smart — 40% recurring is solid.

Layer Cake isn't a competitor. It's the other half.

GHL = marketing automation
Layer Cake = custom app development

Your audience needs both. Same commission structure, additive revenue.

I ran an agency using GHL. It was great for automations. But building custom apps for clients? That was still a nightmare.

Layer Cake fixes the part GHL doesn't touch.

Happy to show you the difference.
```

**Template B: For Dev/Design Influencers**
```
[Name], different angle —

Your audience loves v0, Cursor, Bolt. They can prototype beautiful apps in an hour.

But the backend? Auth, payments, database, multi-tenancy? That's still 2 weeks of work.

I lived this running my agency. Prototype in a day, deliver in a month.

Layer Cake connects any prototype to a production backend in hours.

If your audience builds apps for clients, this is the missing piece.

Worth talking affiliate program?
```

---

### Touch 4: Direct Ask (Day 16)

```
Hey [Name], I'll be direct.

I'm looking for 20 founding affiliates. People who understand the agency delivery problem firsthand.

40% recurring, lifetime. €100 bonus per first sale. Demo account to play with.

Your content on [specific topic] tells me you get what agency owners struggle with.

Two options:
1. Quick 15-min call — I show you the product, we talk terms
2. I send you a demo account first so you can kick the tires

Which works?
```

---

### Touch 5: Breakup (Day 25)

```
Hey [Name], last one from me.

Totally get it if the timing's off or this isn't a fit.

My inbox is always open. We'll fill the founding spots soon, but I'd make room for you later.

Either way — keep doing what you're doing. Your audience is better for it.

## Email Sequence (5-Touch)

### Email 1: The Story Hook

**Subject:** `I took home nothing from a €240k agency`

```
Hi [Name],

I ran a marketing agency for 5 years.

€240,000 in revenue. 4 employees. 6 clients who loved us.

And I took home nothing.

The software stack (GHL, HubSpot, form builders, the endless integrations) cost €500-1,000/month. And every new client took weeks to onboard.

Delivery was the profit killer.

So I built Layer Cake — one platform that replaces the stack. Page builder, CRM, forms, payments, messaging, AI. Agencies can deliver in 2 days what used to take 2 weeks.

I'm looking for 20 affiliates who understand this problem.

Your content tells me you do. Your audience IS me 5 years ago.

Affiliate terms: 40% recurring, lifetime. 10 referrals = €2,000/month.

Interested?

Founder, Layer Cake

### Email 2: The Proof (Day 4)

**Subject:** `Re: I took home nothing from a €240k agency`

```
Hi [Name],

Following up on my story.

The numbers that matter:

THE PROBLEM:
- €500-1,000/month in software costs
- Weeks to onboard every new client
- Breaking even despite €20k/month revenue

THE FIX:
- Layer Cake: one platform, everything built in
- 2 days to deliver what took 2 weeks
- Software cost → basically eliminated

THE AFFILIATE DEAL:
- 40% recurring, lifetime
- €499/month product = €200/month per referral
- 10 referrals = €2,000/month passive
- First 20 get €100 bonus per sale

Your audience lives this problem every day.

Worth 15 minutes to see if there's a fit?

### Email 3: The Wife Story (Day 9)

**Subject:** `She said "just shut it down"`

```
Hi [Name],

February 2024. California. Sitting in a car with my wife outside a restaurant.

Having the conversation every founder dreads.

"The business isn't working. I'm creating work for everyone, but I'm not getting anything out of it."

She looked at me and said: "Then just shut it down."

5 years. €240k in revenue. And that was it.

So I went back to building software. And I built the tool that would've saved my agency.

Layer Cake. One platform. Everything an agency needs to deliver.

The reason I'm telling you this: your audience is living my 2019. Struggling with the same problems I struggled with.

I'm looking for partners who get it. Who can tell their audience: "There's a better way now."

40% recurring, lifetime. Direct access to me. Founding affiliate status.

Still interested?

Remington
```

### Email 4: Different Structure (Day 15)

**Subject:** `Maybe affiliate isn't the right fit`

```
Hi [Name],

I've sent a few emails. Let me try a different angle.

If affiliate programs aren't your thing, I get it. We're also open to:

- Sponsorship (one-time fee for a dedicated video/episode)
- Co-marketing (we promote you, you promote us)
- Interview/podcast appearance (I come on, tell my story, demonstrate the tool)

The story sells itself: founder runs agency for 5 years, breaks even despite €240k revenue, builds the tool that would've saved his business.

Your audience would resonate with that.

What structure works best for you?

Remington
```

### Email 5: Breakup (Day 22)

**Subject:** `Closing the loop`

```
Hi [Name],

Last email from me.

Timing's everything — if now isn't right, I understand.

My inbox is always open. We'll fill founding spots soon, but I'd make room for you.

Keep creating. Your audience is lucky to have you.

## Twitter/X DM Sequence

Worth a quick chat?
```

## Podcast Pitch

**Subject:** `Founder story: €240k agency, €0 profit, and the tool I built to fix it`

```
Hi [Name],

Big fan of [Podcast Name]. Your episode on [specific topic] hit home for me.

I'd love to come on and share a story your listeners will relate to:

THE STORY:
I ran a marketing agency for 5 years. €240k/year revenue. 4 employees. 6 happy clients.

And I took home nothing.

The software stack (€1k/month) and the delivery time (weeks per client) ate everything.

My wife told me to shut it down. So I did.

Then I built Layer Cake — the tool I wish I had. One platform that replaces the entire agency software stack.

WHAT YOUR LISTENERS GET:
→ The real numbers behind "successful" agencies (revenue ≠ profit)
→ Why delivery — not sales — is the profit killer
→ How AI changes the economics of building software
→ The specific tool stack I replaced and how

I can keep it tactical and actionable. No fluff.

Worth exploring?

## Loom Video Script (Personal Outreach)

For high-value targets, record a 60-90 second personal Loom:

```
[SCREEN: Their LinkedIn/YouTube profile visible]

Hey [Name], Remington here.

I've been watching your content on [specific topic] — your [specific video] really resonated.

Quick context on why I'm reaching out:

[SCREEN: Switch to you talking to camera]

I ran a marketing agency for 5 years. €240k in revenue. 4 employees. Clients loved us.

And I took home nothing.

The software costs — GHL, HubSpot, all the tools — and the time it took to deliver for each new client... it ate everything.

My wife told me to shut it down. So I did.

And then I built the tool that would've saved my business.

[SCREEN: Quick Layer Cake dashboard demo — 10 seconds]

Layer Cake. One platform. Everything an agency needs to deliver. What took 2 weeks now takes 2 days.

[SCREEN: Back to you]

I'm looking for 20 affiliates who understand this problem. 40% recurring, lifetime.

Your audience IS me 5 years ago. I think this could be a fit.

I'd love to chat — even just 15 minutes to show you what we built.

Link to my calendar is below. Either way, keep doing what you're doing.

Talk soon.

## Response Handling

### "Tell me more"
```
Happy to!

Quick version: I ran an agency for 5 years, broke even despite €240k revenue, built the tool that would've fixed it.

Layer Cake = one platform replacing GHL, form builders, CRMs, page builders. Agencies deliver in days, not weeks.

Affiliate: 40% recurring lifetime. 10 referrals = €2,000/month.

Want to hop on a quick call? I can demo the product and walk through the setup.

[Calendar link]
```

### "I already promote GHL"
```
Perfect — Layer Cake isn't a replacement, it's the other half.

GHL = marketing automation (and you should keep promoting it)
Layer Cake = custom app development

Your audience needs both. I used GHL for years — it's great at what it does. But building custom apps for clients? Still a nightmare.

Layer Cake fixes that part.

Same commission structure (40% lifetime). Additive revenue, not replacement.

Worth a quick chat to see the difference?
```

### "Never heard of Layer Cake"
```
That's the point — we're new.

Which means: no saturation, first-mover advantage, founding affiliate terms (€100 bonus per sale on top of 40%).

I'm not looking for thousands of affiliates. I'm looking for 20 who get the problem.

Your content tells me you do.

Want to see what we built?
```

### "My audience isn't technical"
```
Neither was I when I started my agency.

If your audience has ever:
- Wished they could build apps for clients
- Complained about the tech complexity
- Used v0, Lovable, or any prototype tool
- Struggled with "the backend part"

They need Layer Cake.

It's built for non-technical people who want to deliver technical products.

Worth showing you?
```

### "Not doing affiliate stuff right now"
```
Totally understand.

If a different structure works better — sponsorship, one-time partnership, podcast interview — I'm open.

The story resonates: founder runs agency for 5 years, breaks even, builds the fix.

Let me know what format works for you.
```
