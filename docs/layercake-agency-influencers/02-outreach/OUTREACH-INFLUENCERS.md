## The Angle for Each Persona

### Agency Coaches
**Their identity:** "I help agency owners succeed"
**What they care about:** Tools that make their students more successful
**The pitch:** "Your students are spending €1k/month on tools and weeks on delivery. This fixes that. You look good when they win."

### GHL Influencers
**Their identity:** "I help people build with GoHighLevel"
**What they care about:** Not cannibalizing their GHL income
**The pitch:** "This isn't a competitor. GHL = automation. Layer Cake = app building. Same audience, additive revenue, same 40%."

### Agency YouTubers/Podcasters
**Their identity:** "I educate and entertain agency owners"
**What they care about:** Great content, audience trust, revenue
**The pitch:** "My story (€240k revenue, €0 profit) is content your audience will binge. Plus 40% recurring."

### SaaS Reviewers
**Their identity:** "I help people find the right tools"
**What they care about:** Being first, honest reviews, affiliate revenue
**The pitch:** "New platform, no other affiliates yet. First-mover advantage. I'll give you full access."

## LinkedIn Sequences by Persona

### AGENCY COACHES

**Connection Request:**
```
Hey [Name] — I've followed your work helping agency owners scale.

I ran an agency for 5 years. €240k revenue, broke even. Built the tool that would've changed everything.

Looking for a few coaches to partner with. Think there's a fit.
```

**Message 1 (Day 1):**
```
[Name], thanks for connecting.

Quick context: I spent 5 years running an agency. €240k revenue, 4 employees, great clients.

Took home nothing.

The software stack (€1k/month) and delivery time (weeks per client) ate everything.

Here's why I'm reaching out to YOU:

Your students are living what I lived. They're spending a fortune on tools, drowning in delivery, wondering why they can't get ahead.

I built Layer Cake to fix that. One platform that replaces the stack. Agencies deliver in 2 days what used to take 2 weeks.

I'm looking for 5 coaches to partner with — not mass affiliates, real partners.

40% recurring, lifetime. But more importantly: your students win, you look good.

Worth a conversation?
```

**Message 2 (Day 5):**
```
[Name], following up.

I know you're protective of what you recommend to your students. You should be.

That's exactly why I'm reaching out to you specifically — not blasting every influencer I can find.

Your students trust you. If Layer Cake helps them deliver faster and keep more profit, that trust deepens.

I'd love to show you what we built. 15 minutes, no pressure.

If it's not a fit, no hard feelings. But I think you'll see why your students need this.
```

**Message 3 (Day 12):**
```
Last one from me, [Name].

The offer: 40% recurring, lifetime. Founding partner status (only taking 20). Direct line to me.

But the real value: a tool that makes your coaching more effective. When your students can deliver in 2 days instead of 2 weeks, YOUR methods work better.

If timing's off, door's always open.

Either way — keep doing what you do. Agency owners need coaches like you.

### GHL ECOSYSTEM INFLUENCERS

**Connection Request:**
```
[Name] — love your GHL content. You've clearly figured out the affiliate game.

I built something complementary (not competing). Same 40%, different product.

Worth connecting?
```

**Message 1 (Day 1):**
```
Hey [Name], appreciate the connect.

I'll cut to it: I know you're making good money with GHL. You should be — 40% recurring is solid.

I'm not here to compete with that. Layer Cake is the OTHER half.

GHL = marketing automation. Email sequences, funnels, CRM.
Layer Cake = custom app building. Auth, payments, database, multi-tenancy.

Your audience uses GHL to run their marketing. But when a client says "build me an app" — GHL doesn't do that.

Layer Cake does.

Same commission structure: 40% recurring, lifetime.
Same audience: agency owners.
Additive revenue: not replacement.

I ran an agency for 5 years using GHL. It's great at what it does. But delivery was still killing me. That's the gap Layer Cake fills.

Want to see how they work together?
```

**Message 2 (Day 5):**
```
[Name], quick follow-up.

The math: you're probably making solid recurring from GHL.

Layer Cake is pure upside. Same audience, different use case, same 40%.

Your followers who already trust your GHL recommendation will trust this too — because it solves a problem GHL doesn't touch.

I'm taking 20 founding affiliates. €100 bonus per first sale on top of the 40%.

Worth a quick call to see it?
```

**Message 3 (Day 12):**
```
[Name], last message.

I get it if you're focused on GHL. Smart to go deep on one thing.

But if you ever want to diversify without competing with yourself — Layer Cake is sitting here.

Door's open whenever.

### AGENCY YOUTUBERS / PODCASTERS

**Connection Request:**
```
[Name] — been watching your content on [specific topic]. Your [specific video/episode] nailed it.

I have a story your audience would love. €240k agency, €0 profit, and the tool I built to fix it.

Connect?
```

**Message 1 (Day 1):**
```
Hey [Name], thanks for connecting.

I'll give you the short version of my story — because I think it's content your audience would resonate with.

5 years running a marketing agency. €240,000/year revenue. 4 employees. Great clients.

Took home: nothing.

The software stack (GHL, HubSpot, all the tools) cost €1k/month. And every new client took weeks to onboard.

Delivery was the profit killer.

February 2024, my wife looked at me and said: "Just shut it down."

So I did. And I built the tool that would've saved my agency.

Layer Cake: one platform that replaces the entire stack. Agencies deliver in 2 days what used to take 2 weeks.

Here's why I'm reaching out:

1. Your audience is living my 2019. Struggling with the same problems.
2. This story is CONTENT. Whether you want to do an interview, review, or just tell the story — it writes itself.
3. We have an affiliate program: 40% recurring, lifetime.

Want to chat about what might work?
```

**Message 2 (Day 5):**
```
[Name], following up with the numbers.

If affiliate is interesting:
- 40% recurring, lifetime
- €499/month product = €200/month per referral
- 10 referrals = €2,000/month

If content/interview is more your style:
- I'll come on your show
- Tell the full story (€240k → €0 → built the fix)
- Demo the product live

Either way, your audience gets value. Let me know what format works.
```

**Message 3 (Day 12):**
```
[Name], last note.

Whether it's affiliate, sponsorship, or just an interview — I'm flexible.

The story resonates. Your audience is agency owners struggling with the exact problem I solved.

Door's open whenever timing works.

[Remington]

### SAAS REVIEWERS / TOOL INFLUENCERS

**Connection Request:**
```
[Name] — love your reviews on [tools they've covered].

Built something new in the agency space. No other affiliates yet. Thought you'd want first look.
```

**Message 1 (Day 1):**
```
Hey [Name], thanks for connecting.

I'll keep it short: I built Layer Cake.

One platform for agencies: page builder, CRM, forms, payments, messaging, AI. Replaces the €1k/month tool stack.

Why I'm reaching out to YOU:

1. You review tools. This is a new one worth covering.
2. No other affiliates yet. You'd be first.
3. We're doing 40% recurring, lifetime — and I'll give you full access to play with it.

The backstory: I ran an agency for 5 years, €240k revenue, broke even because of tool costs and delivery time. Built this to fix it.

Want a demo account to kick the tires?
```

**Message 2 (Day 5):**
```
[Name], following up.

Happy to give you:
- Full demo account (no restrictions)
- Direct access to me for questions
- Founding affiliate terms (40% + €100 per first sale)

You can review it honestly. If it's not good, don't promote it. But I think you'll like what you see.

Interested?
```

**Message 3 (Day 12):**
```
Last one from me, [Name].

New tool. No saturation. First-mover advantage.

If you ever want to cover it, I'm here.

[Remington]
```

## Email Sequences

### FOR COACHES

**Email 1:**
**Subject:** `Your students are bleeding €1k/month on tools`

```
Hi [Name],

I've been following your work with agency owners. What you teach matters.

Quick story: I ran an agency for 5 years. €240k in revenue. Broke even.

The problem wasn't sales. It was delivery.

€500-1,000/month in software (GHL, HubSpot, the whole stack). Weeks to onboard every client. Happy customers, zero profit.

Your students are living this right now.

I built Layer Cake to fix it. One platform. Everything an agency needs. Delivery in 2 days, not 2 weeks.

I'm not looking for mass affiliates. I'm looking for 5 coaches to partner with.

40% recurring, lifetime. But more importantly: when your students win, you look good.

Worth a conversation?

**Email 2:**
**Subject:** `Re: Your students are bleeding €1k/month on tools`

```
Hi [Name],

Following up.

I know you're protective of your reputation. That's why I'm reaching out to YOU specifically — not blasting every influencer.

Layer Cake helps your students:
- Cut software costs from €1k/month to one platform
- Deliver client work in 2 days, not 2 weeks
- Actually keep profit from their revenue

When they succeed, your coaching looks better.

For you:
- 40% recurring, lifetime
- Founding partner status (only 20 spots)
- Direct line to me

15 minutes to see if there's a fit?

### FOR GHL INFLUENCERS

**Email 1:**
**Subject:** `Additive to GHL, not competitive`

```
Hi [Name],

I know you're doing well with GoHighLevel. Smart move — 40% recurring is great.

I'm not here to compete with that.

Layer Cake is the OTHER half of the stack.

GHL = marketing automation (what you already promote)
Layer Cake = custom app building (auth, payments, database)

Your audience uses GHL for marketing. But when a client says "build me an app" — they need Layer Cake.

Same 40% recurring, lifetime. Same audience. Additive revenue.

I ran an agency using GHL for years. It's great. But delivery on custom work was still killing me. That's the gap I built Layer Cake to fill.

Worth a quick call to see how they work together?

Remington
```

### FOR PODCASTERS

**Email 1:**
**Subject:** `Guest pitch: €240k agency, €0 profit, and the tool I built`

```
Hi [Name],

I've got a story your audience will resonate with.

I ran a marketing agency for 5 years. €240,000/year revenue. 4 employees. Great clients.

Took home: nothing.

The software stack cost €1k/month. Delivery took weeks per client. Profit margin: zero.

My wife told me to shut it down. So I did.

Then I built the tool that would've saved my agency.

Layer Cake: one platform that replaces the entire stack. Agencies deliver in 2 days, not 2 weeks.

For your show:
- The real numbers behind "successful" agencies (revenue ≠ profit)
- Why delivery — not sales — is the profit killer
- The specific tech stack I replaced and how

I can keep it tactical. No fluff.

We also have an affiliate program (40% lifetime) if that's relevant — but honestly, the story is the content.

Worth exploring?

Remington
Founder, Layer Cake

## Response Templates

### "I already promote GHL"
```
Perfect — that's why I reached out.

Layer Cake isn't a competitor. It's complementary.

GHL = marketing automation (keep promoting it)
Layer Cake = custom app building

Your audience needs both. Same 40%, additive revenue.

Want to see how they work together?
```

### "What's the product exactly?"
```
One-liner: Layer Cake turns v0 prototypes into production apps.

The longer version: I ran an agency paying €1k/month for GHL + HubSpot + form builders + page builders. Every client took weeks to deliver.

Layer Cake is one platform with all of it: page builder, CRM, forms, payments, messaging, AI.

Agencies deliver in 2 days what used to take 2 weeks.

Want me to show you?
```

### "I don't do affiliate marketing"
```
Totally fair.

We're also open to:
- Sponsorship (one-time fee for dedicated content)
- Interview (I come on, tell my story, demo the product)
- Co-marketing (we promote you, you promote us)

The story writes itself: €240k agency, €0 profit, built the fix.

What format works for you?
```

### "Send me more info"
```
Happy to.

Quick overview:
- One platform replacing the €1k/month agency stack
- Page builder, CRM, forms, payments, messaging, AI
- Agencies deliver in 2 days, not 2 weeks

Affiliate terms:
- 40% recurring, lifetime
- €499/month product = €200/month per referral
- Founding partner: €100 bonus per first sale

My story (optional context): Ran agency 5 years, €240k revenue, broke even, wife said shut it down, built Layer Cake.

Want to hop on a quick call to see it live?
```

### "I'll think about it"
```
Take your time.

Happy to send a demo account so you can play with it first. No commitment — just kick the tires.

Want me to set that up?
