## Script

```
Let me tell you what's broken about how most builders try to make money.

You can build. Maybe you can even vibe code - use AI tools to ship things fast. You've got the technical skills.

But delivering to a real client? Scoping a project so it doesn't spiral? Communicating when requirements change? Pricing your work so you actually keep money at the end? Shipping on deadline when things break?

Nobody teaches that. Not courses. Not tutorials. Not YouTube videos.

I know, because I learned it the hardest way possible.

I ran a marketing agency for five years. €240,000 a year in recurring revenue. Four employees. Our clients loved us. And I took home nothing.

The software stack cost up to a thousand euros a month. Every new client took weeks to set up. My team was working full bore, but the delivery overhead ate all the profit.

There was a moment where I had to be honest with myself. I was spinning my wheels. Working harder than ever and ending up with nothing left.

So I shut it down. Went back to what I know - software engineering - and built the systems I wished I had. The delivery frameworks. The scoping system. The client communication playbook. The productization framework. All of it.

And now I want to hand all of that to you.

That's what the apprenticeship is.

It's not a course. And it's not just "here's a task, figure it out." It's an intensive coaching program where you work WITH me on real client projects - and I give you every framework, system, and shortcut I've built over 20 years.

Here's what you get.

My Rapid Scoping System - how to scope a project in hours, not weeks, so you know exactly what to build, what to skip, and what to charge.

My Client Communication Playbook - templates for onboarding, updates, scope changes, and difficult conversations.

My Vibe Coding Workflow - how to use Cursor, Claude, and v0 to build production-quality software ten times faster.

My Delivery Pipeline - the step-by-step system from client kickoff to paid invoice. Repeatable for every project.

My Productization Framework - how to turn custom work into repeatable packages so you stop trading hours for dollars.

And you don't just get the frameworks. You use them. On real projects. With real clients. With real money on the line.

When we deliver, you get paid. Revenue share on every project you help ship.

Here's how it works.

You apply. Show me what you've built - side projects, client work, anything. Tell me what kind of delivery excites you and where you want to grow.

If there's a fit, we talk. I learn your goals and skills. You learn what's in my pipeline.

We find your project. Could be a client automation, a SaaS MVP, a lead gen system. Something that matches your skills and stretches you.

We agree on terms. Revenue share based on the project scope and your contribution. Every deal is custom.

Then we ship. Daily async communication. Real tasks. Real deadlines. I guide the architecture and client relationship. You build. We deliver together.

And when the client pays, you get your share. Plus you walk away with proof you can deliver, my frameworks in your toolbox, and a reference when you're ready to go solo.

Now here's who this is NOT for.

If you're a complete beginner who's never built anything - you need fundamentals first, not client pressure.

If you just want to learn more without actually delivering - this is about earning, not collecting knowledge.

If you disappear when things get hard - client projects have deadlines.

If you expect someone else to do the work - I coach and guide, I don't build for you.

But if you can build and you're ready to learn how to DELIVER. If you want systems, not guesswork. If you're tired of figuring it out alone...

This is how you go from builder to operator.

Apply below. Tell me what you've built, who you want to serve, and why you're ready.

I review every application personally. If it's a fit, we talk. If not, I'll tell you exactly what to work on first.

Let's build something real.

## Shot Notes

- Direct to camera
- Confident, slightly intense energy
- Longer pauses for emphasis on the founder story beats
- Background: office/studio
- Can cut to B-roll of you working if available
- The "honest with myself" moment should land emotionally - slow down there
