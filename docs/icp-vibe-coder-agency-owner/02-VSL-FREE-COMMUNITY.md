## Script

```
If you're running an agency or freelancing with AI tools and your software stack is eating all your profit - you're in the right place.

I'm Remington. I ran a marketing agency for five years. €240,000 a year in revenue. Four employees. And I took home nothing. The software costs and delivery time ate everything.

So I shut it down, went back to building software, and created the tool that would have saved my agency.

This community is free. Delivery frameworks, templates, and other agency owners who are solving the same problems. The more you participate, the more you unlock.

Want to go deeper? There's a premium tier with the full template library and office hours with me.

And if you're serious - the apprenticeship program. I hand you my delivery frameworks, you work on real client projects with me, and you get paid.

But start here. Tell us what you're building and who you're building it for.

Link's below. Let's go.
