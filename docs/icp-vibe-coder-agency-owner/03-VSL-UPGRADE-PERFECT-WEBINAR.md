## Script

```
[HOOK]

Most agency owners and builders stay broke not because they can't build - but because they never fix the three things that are bleeding their profit. In the next two minutes, I'm going to tell you what they are. And if you want to shortcut the whole process, I'll show you how.

[STORY]

I ran a marketing agency for five years. €240,000 a year in recurring revenue. Four employees. Our clients loved us. And I took home nothing.

Not because I couldn't sell. Not because I couldn't build. Because my delivery was broken. The software stack cost a thousand euros a month. Every new client took weeks to onboard. The more clients I got, the more I worked, and the less I kept.

There was a moment where I had to be honest with myself - I was spinning my wheels. So I shut it down, went back to engineering, and built the systems I wished I had.

Here's what I learned the hard way.

[CONTENT - 3 Secrets]

Secret one: Your problem isn't more clients. It's delivery. Most agency owners think they need to sell more. Wrong. You need to deliver faster and cheaper. If onboarding a client takes you three weeks and costs you hundreds in tools, you'll never be profitable at scale.

Secret two: You don't need ten tools. You need one system. GoHighLevel, Airtable, Zapier, Stripe, Calendly - they don't talk to each other. Every integration is a point of failure. Every tool is another bill. One unified platform replaces the duct tape.

Secret three: You need to productize, not customize. If every client gets a bespoke setup, you're trading hours for dollars forever. Build it once, deliver it many times. That's how you go from freelancer to operator.

These three things are why I was breaking even at €20K a month - and they're what I fixed.

[STACK]

Now, I put everything I know about this into two tiers inside this community.

Premium is €29 a month. You get the full template library - delivery checklists, scoping frameworks, outreach scripts, pricing tools, client onboarding systems. The stuff that took me years to figure out.

VIP is €49 a month. You get everything in Premium plus live access to me. Office hours twice a month. Monthly group calls. Bring your delivery problem, get real feedback. Plus sales and agency content on pricing, handling objections, and closing.

[CLOSE]

If you're serious about keeping the money you earn - not just making more revenue that disappears into tools and setup time - pick your tier and let's fix your delivery.

And if you want to skip the line entirely - learn my delivery frameworks hands-on, work on real client projects with me, and get paid - check out the Apprenticeship module. That's for people who are ready to stop guessing and start delivering.

See you inside.
