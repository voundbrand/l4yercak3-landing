          { question: "How much time do I need to commit?", answer: "It depends on the project and your availability. Some projects need 10-15 hours/week, others need more intensive sprints. We figure out what works during our call — I'd rather have someone focused 15 hours than scattered across 40." },
          { question: "What if I'm not ready yet?", answer: "I'll tell you honestly. If your application shows you need more fundamentals, I'll point you to specific resources and invite you to reapply when you've leveled up. No hard feelings — better to wait than to struggle." },
          { question: "Do I need to know specific technologies?", answer: "Depends on the project. Most of my work is JavaScript/TypeScript (React, Next.js, Node), but I also have projects in Python, mobile (React Native), and no-code/low-code tools. We match projects to your stack." },
          { question: "Can I work on multiple projects?", answer: "Yes. Many apprentices stay for 2-3+ projects. Each project is a new agreement with new terms. The longer we work together, the more I trust you with bigger opportunities." },

Wir können auch gemeinsam neue Projekte identifizieren basierend auf deinen Interessen und Marktchancen." },

Es hängt ab vom Projektumfang, deinem Beitragslevel, Timeline und Marktpotenzial. Ich will dich nicht ausnutzen — ich will einen Deal, bei dem wir beide gewinnen." },
          { question: "Wie viel Zeit muss ich investieren?", answer: "Hängt vom Projekt und deiner Verfügbarkeit ab. Manche Projekte brauchen 10-15 Stunden/Woche, andere intensivere Sprints. Wir klären das im Gespräch — lieber jemand fokussiert 15 Stunden als verstreut über 40." },
          { question: "Was, wenn ich noch nicht bereit bin?", answer: "Ich sag es dir ehrlich.

Keine harten Gefühle — besser warten als kämpfen." },

Wir matchen Projekte zu deinem Stack." },

          { question: "Wie lang dauert ein typisches Projekt?", answer: "Variiert stark. Manche sind 2-4 Wochen Sprints. Andere sind laufende Beziehungen mit monatlichen Deliverables. Wir besprechen Timeline-Erwartungen bevor wir anfangen — keine Überraschungen." },
          { question: "Was passiert danach?", answer: "Du gehst mit Portfolio-Stücken, meiner Empfehlung und den Skills, um deine eigenen Kunden zu landen.
