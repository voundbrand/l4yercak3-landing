Pricing your work so you actually make money. Shipping on deadline when things break.\n\nNobody teaches this. Not courses, not tutorials, not YouTube videos. You only learn delivery by doing it — under real constraints, with real money on the line.\n\nThat's why most builders stay stuck. They can build anything, but they can't productize themselves.

We figure out what works during our call — I'd rather have someone focused 15 hours than scattered across 40." },
          { question: "What if I'm not ready yet?", answer: "I'll tell you honestly. If your application shows you need more fundamentals, I'll point you to specific resources and invite you to reapply when you've leveled up. No hard feelings — better to wait than to struggle." },

Learning curve is brutal.\n\nThere's a growing group of agency owners frustrated with GHL. They're searching for alternatives right now.\n\nYou're not convincing happy GHL users to switch. You're reaching the people ready for something better.",

        {
          question: "What makes Layer Cake actually better?",
          answer: "Three things:\n\n1. AI-native — GHL added AI features. Layer Cake was BUILT on AI. Describe what you want. It builds it.\n\n2. Simpler — GHL takes 3+ weeks to learn. Layer Cake takes days.\n\n3. Custom apps — GHL does funnels and automations. Layer Cake does that PLUS real custom app building (auth, payments, dashboards, multi-tenancy).\n\nIt's the evolution, not just an alternative.",

Das ist ein komplett anderes Spiel.\n\nEin Projekt scopen, damit es nicht ausufert. Mit Kunden kommunizieren, wenn sich Anforderungen ändern. Wissen, was man zuerst baut und was man weglässt. Deine Arbeit so bepreisen, dass du wirklich Geld verdienst. Pünktlich liefern, wenn Dinge kaputt gehen.\n\nDas lehrt niemand. Nicht Kurse, nicht Tutorials, nicht YouTube-Videos. Man lernt Delivery nur durch Machen — unter echten Bedingungen, mit echtem Geld auf dem Spiel.\n\nDeshalb bleiben die meisten Builder stecken. Sie können alles bauen, aber sie können sich nicht produktisieren. Sie können ihre Delivery nicht zu einem wiederholbaren System vereinfachen. Und ohne das fängt jedes Projekt bei null an.",

Wir können auch gemeinsam neue Projekte identifizieren basierend auf deinen Interessen und Marktchancen." },

Es hängt ab vom Projektumfang, deinem Beitragslevel, Timeline und Marktpotenzial. Ich will dich nicht ausnutzen — ich will einen Deal, bei dem wir beide gewinnen." },
          { question: "Wie viel Zeit muss ich investieren?", answer: "Hängt vom Projekt und deiner Verfügbarkeit ab. Manche Projekte brauchen 10-15 Stunden/Woche, andere intensivere Sprints. Wir klären das im Gespräch — lieber jemand fokussiert 15 Stunden als verstreut über 40." },
          { question: "Was, wenn ich noch nicht bereit bin?", answer: "Ich sag es dir ehrlich.

Wir matchen Projekte zu deinem Stack." },
          { question: "Kann ich an mehreren Projekten arbeiten?", answer: "Ja. Viele Apprentices bleiben für 2-3+ Projekte. Jedes Projekt ist eine neue Vereinbarung mit neuen Konditionen. Je länger wir zusammenarbeiten, desto mehr vertraue ich dir größere Möglichkeiten an." },
          { question: "Wie lang dauert ein typisches Projekt?", answer: "Variiert stark. Manche sind 2-4 Wochen Sprints. Andere sind laufende Beziehungen mit monatlichen Deliverables. Wir besprechen Timeline-Erwartungen bevor wir anfangen — keine Überraschungen." },
