Every new client: two to three weeks to onboard. My team spent more time fighting the tools than doing the work.\n\nI watched my team sit there waiting for pages to load. I watched automations send the wrong emails to the wrong people. I called support and got a ticket number and silence. I opened Stripe in a separate tab because my \u201call-in-one\u201d platform couldn\u2019t handle a simple cancellation.\n\nI was the bottleneck. Every new client meant more tools, more setup, more hours. \u20ac240k in revenue. Nothing left at the end of the month.\n\nSo I shut it down.\n\nWent back to what I actually know\u2014software engineering. Twenty years of it. And I built the platform that would have saved my agency.\n\nOne place to configure everything a client needs \u2014 pages, CRM, email, payments, booking. White-label it under my brand. Deploy in minutes instead of weeks. Move on to the next client.\n\nThat\u2019s Layer Cake.",
