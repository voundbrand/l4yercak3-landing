    story: "I ran a marketing agency for five years. \u20ac240,000 a year in recurring revenue. Four employees. Great clients.\n\nAnd I took home nothing.\n\nEvery month: \u20ac500 to \u20ac1,000 in software. GoHighLevel, HubSpot, form builders, email tools\u2014the whole stack. Every new client: two to three weeks to onboard. My team spent more time fighting the tools than doing the work.\n\nI watched my team sit there waiting for pages to load. I watched automations send the wrong emails to the wrong people. I called support and got a ticket number and silence. I opened Stripe in a separate tab because my \u201call-in-one\u201d platform couldn\u2019t handle a simple cancellation.\n\nI was the bottleneck. Every new client meant more tools, more setup, more hours. \u20ac240k in revenue. Nothing left at the end of the month.\n\nSo I shut it down.\n\nWent back to what I actually know\u2014software engineering. Twenty years of it. And I built the platform that would have saved my agency.\n\nOne place to configure everything a client needs \u2014 pages, CRM, email, payments, booking. White-label it under my brand. Deploy in minutes instead of weeks. Move on to the next client.\n\nThat\u2019s Layer Cake.",

Zufriedene Kunden.\n\nUnd ich habe nichts davon behalten.\n\nJeden Monat: \u20ac500 bis \u20ac1.000 f\u00fcr Software. GoHighLevel, HubSpot, Formular-Tools, E-Mail-Tools\u2014der ganze Stack. Jeder neue Kunde: zwei bis drei Wochen Onboarding. Mein Team hat mehr Zeit damit verbracht, gegen die Tools zu k\u00e4mpfen als zu arbeiten.\n\nIch habe zugesehen, wie mein Team auf ladende Seiten gewartet hat. Wie Automatisierungen die falschen E-Mails an die falschen Leute geschickt haben. Ich habe den Support angerufen und eine Ticketnummer und Stille bekommen. Ich habe Stripe in einem separaten Tab ge\u00f6ffnet, weil meine \u201eAlles-in-einem\u201c-Plattform nicht mal eine K\u00fcndigung verarbeiten konnte.\n\nIch war der Flaschenhals. Jeder neue Kunde bedeutete mehr Tools, mehr Setup, mehr Stunden. \u20ac240k Umsatz. Nichts \u00fcbrig am Monatsende.\n\nAlso habe ich zugemacht.\n\nBin zur\u00fcckgegangen zu dem, was ich wirklich kann\u2014Softwareentwicklung. Zwanzig Jahre davon. Und ich habe die Plattform gebaut, die meine Agentur gerettet h\u00e4tte.\n\nEin Ort, um alles zu konfigurieren, was ein Kunde braucht \u2014 Seiten, CRM, E-Mail, Zahlungen, Buchungen. White-Label unter meiner Marke. In Minuten deployen statt in Wochen. Weiter zum n\u00e4chsten Kunden.\n\nDas ist Layer Cake.",
