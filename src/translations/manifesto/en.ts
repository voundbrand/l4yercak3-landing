  preview: `"You can build anything. But nobody's buying.

You've shipped apps. Completed projects. Written code that actually works. You're not a beginner anymore.

Yet your hard drive is a graveyard of products nobody used. Your launches got likes from other developers, not customers. Your MRR is still zero.

Here's the uncomfortable truth: Building is the easy part. The skills that got you here won't get you there.

You don't need another tutorial. You don't need a better idea. You need to learn the other half of the game—the half they never taught you.

Stop starting over. Start stacking wins."`,

    pointSolutionEra: {
      title: "The Tutorial Trap",
      content: `You've watched the videos. Taken the courses. Built the apps.

You can spin up a SaaS in a weekend. You've shipped more MVPs than most developers will in their entire careers. You're not struggling with code—you're struggling with customers.

And here's where it gets worse: The more you build, the more you believe the next project will be different. This time the idea is better. This time the execution is cleaner. This time it'll work.

It won't.

Because the problem was never the product.

The problem is you've mastered half the game and ignored the other half entirely. You learned to build. You never learned to sell.

The market doesn't reward the best products. It rewards the products that find their buyers.

Tutorial hell isn't about learning to code. It's about learning the same skills over and over while avoiding the uncomfortable ones that actually matter.`

      systemsThinking: {
        title: "1. Building is Only Half the Game",
        content: `Every successful founder knows something you haven't learned yet:

The code is maybe 30% of the work. Positioning, messaging, distribution, sales, pricing, customer research—that's where products live or die.

You've been optimizing the 30% while ignoring the 70%.

Not because you're lazy. Because nobody taught you. Because the developer community celebrates shipping code, not shipping revenue. Because "marketing" feels like a dirty word.

It's not. It's the difference between a side project and a business.`

      humansAI: {
        title: "2. AI Accelerates, It Doesn't Replace",
        content: `AI tools let you build faster than ever. Cursor, Claude, v0, Bolt—you can ship in days what used to take months.

But here's what AI can't do for you:

It can't tell you what to build. It can't find your customers. It can't position your product. It can't have the sales conversations. It can't handle objections. It can't build trust.

AI is a multiplier. If your strategy is zero, 10x zero is still zero.

The builders who win aren't replacing themselves with AI. They're using AI to move faster while focusing their human energy on what actually matters: understanding customers and solving real problems.`

      expansionOverAcquisition: {
        title: "3. Finishing Beats Starting",
        content: `Your graveyard of half-finished projects isn't a learning experience. It's a pattern.

Every time you abandon a project, you lose. Not because the idea was good—it might have been terrible. But because you never stayed long enough to learn what was wrong.

The founders who make it aren't the ones with the best first ideas. They're the ones who stayed in the game long enough to iterate their way to something that works.

Starting is easy. Starting is fun. Starting is where you feel like anything is possible.

Finishing is where you learn. Finishing is where you grow. Finishing is where the money is.

You don't have an idea problem. You have a finishing problem.`
      },
      privacyAsRight: {
        title: "4. Selling Isn't Sleazy",
        content: `Somewhere along the way, you decided that sales was manipulative. That marketing was for charlatans. That good products sell themselves.

This is the biggest lie in tech.

Good products don't sell themselves. They die in obscurity while worse products with better marketing take over the market.

Selling isn't convincing people to buy things they don't need. Selling is finding people with problems and showing them you can solve those problems.

If your product actually helps people, not selling it is selfish. You're keeping the solution away from the people who need it because you're uncomfortable having conversations.

The discomfort you feel about sales is costing you everything.`
      },
      compoundLearning: {
        title: "5. Community Beats Isolation",
        content: `You've been trying to figure this out alone.

Reading blog posts. Watching YouTube videos. Lurking on Reddit. Absorbing advice from people you'll never talk to.

And it's not working.

Because building a business isn't an information problem. It's an accountability problem. A feedback problem. A "someone needs to tell you your idea is bad before you spend 6 months building it" problem.

The builders who make it aren't smarter. They're surrounded by other builders who push them, challenge them, and hold them accountable.

Isolation feels safe. Community delivers results.`
      },
      invisibleIntegration: {
        title: "6. Experience Beats Theory",
        content: `You can read every book on sales. Watch every video on marketing. Take every course on positioning.

None of it matters until you do the thing.

The gap between knowing and doing is where most builders die. They become experts in theory while staying amateurs in practice.

Real learning happens in the field. Talking to customers. Getting rejected. Adjusting your pitch. Trying again. Failing better.

The fastest way to learn isn't consumption. It's action with feedback.`
      },
      compoundPlatforms: {
        title: "7. Small Wins Compound",
        content: `You're waiting for the big break. The viral launch. The hockey stick growth chart.

It doesn't work that way.

Every successful founder you admire built their audience slowly. First customers came one at a time. Growth happened through consistent, boring effort over months and years.

The overnight successes you see? They're the visible tip of years of invisible work.

Stop waiting for the breakthrough. Start stacking small wins. First conversation. First signup. First dollar. First hundred. First thousand.

Each small win creates momentum. Momentum creates confidence. Confidence creates the next win.

This is how it actually works.`
